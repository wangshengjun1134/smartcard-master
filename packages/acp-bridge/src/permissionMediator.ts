 *
 * **Bridge-side precondition**: callers MUST NOT forward an incoming
 * `vote.optionId === CANCEL_VOTE_SENTINEL` from a wire client — the
 * mediator treats the sentinel as cancel intent without consulting the
 * `allowedOptionIds` set, so wire-originated sentinel votes would
 * silently flip a real approval into a cancel. The bridge constructs
 * the sentinel only from a `{outcome:'cancelled'}` ACP body that
 * carries no `optionId` of its own.
 *
 * **Cross-policy escape hatch (intentional)**: cancel routes BEFORE
 * policy dispatch. A non-loopback voter under `local-only` and a
 * not-in-voter-set client under `consensus` can both still resolve the
 * pending as cancelled by posting `{outcome:'cancelled'}`. This is
 * deliberate — voter-cancel is the agent-side abort path; if the
 * threat model required policy-gated cancel, that would be a future
 * contract change. Documented here so a future maintainer doesn't
 * "fix" the bypass.
 *
 * **Collision defense**: `mediator.request` rejects records whose
 * `allowedOptionIds` contains the sentinel by throwing

   * acceptable; document if a longer-window source of empty-voter
   * snapshots emerges.
   *
   * **Late-joiner timing window** (voter snapshot timing).
   * The bridge sequence is `entry.events.publish(...)` →
   * (synchronous) → `await mediator.request(record, ...)`. The
   * publish is synchronous (`EventBus.publish` returns after fanning
   * to in-memory subscriber queues, no event-loop yield) and the
   * mediator's Promise executor is also synchronous through this
   * call (synchronous-register invariant), so a NEW HTTP client cannot register its
   * `clientId` on `entry.clientIds` between publish and snapshot.
   * However, an SSE subscriber that connected BEFORE the publish but
   * has NOT yet hit any session route (no `X-Qwen-Client-Id` known

   * silently rejects its later vote as `forbidden`. UIs that surface
   * the active voter set (eligible-voters chip) should treat

   * client-identity registrations. This version does not surface
