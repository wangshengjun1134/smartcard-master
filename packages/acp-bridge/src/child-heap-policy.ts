   * - **Channel swaps at full occupancy.** The decision reads

   *   replacement spawned before the old child exits transiently makes the
   *   count one higher than steady state. Where `MAX_MODELED_ACP_CHILDREN` is the
   *   binding term (`childPoolMb >= 12800`, i.e. a ~32 GB host and up), a
   *   daemon at 25 live children books a refusal on every channel replacement,
   *   with no memory pressure involved. Do not net this out by giving the
   *   comparison swap headroom: that would admit a 26th ceiling against a
   *   25-child pool, trading a metric artifact for real overcommit.
   * - **Hosts too small to model a partition.** `maxConcurrentChildren` is 0
   *   there, so this equals the total ACP spawn count. Correct by the
   *   definition and alarming to read; `insufficientMemory` on the budget is
   *   the field that says why.
