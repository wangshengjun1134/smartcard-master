 * path lives in the one directory reviewed code can still write, so any

 * skips with a warning, because a silent skip is how a missing mirror
 * re-opens #9205 for pre-move builds with nobody told.
 *
 * The replacement write never FOLLOWS what stands at the path (R27-7,
 * R30-8, R30-39): it writes a unique sibling and `renameSync`s it over the
 * name — rename replaces a symlink itself rather than writing through it,
 * so a planted link cannot aim this host-side write at a file outside the
 * mount, and a readerless FIFO at the name is never opened at all. A plain
 * `writeFileSync(legacy, …)` here was the one host-side write into the
 * mounted directory that followed whatever was at the path — `O_TRUNC`
 * through a swapped-in symlink is an arbitrary-file-write primitive from
 * the mount against the host filesystem.
