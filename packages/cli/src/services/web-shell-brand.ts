 * nothing to stderr. This is a correctness check, not a security boundary.

 * this" is answered by the same engine class rather than by a reimplemented
 * case set: duplicate attributes, junk after the root element, undeclared
 * entities, out-of-range character references, malformed comments and the
 * rest are all well-formedness errors it reports. Attribute values arrive
 * entity-decoded, exactly once — the same single decode a browser applies.
 * Namespace processing is enabled because browsers always have it (jsdom
