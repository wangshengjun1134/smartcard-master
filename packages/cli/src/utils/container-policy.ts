  // The list was the first design and it lost twice: it named the daemon
  // selectors and missed the proxy family, then named those and missed
  // `DOCKER_API_VERSION` — a value that does not select a daemon at all, it
  // just makes every call to one fail, which under `auto` turns containment
  // off silently because the availability probe reads a broken client as "no
  // runtime". The class is not "variables that point somewhere else", it is
  // "variables a repository can set that change what this client does", and
  // that has no last entry: an incompatible API version, a proxy, a config
  // path, a `PATH` naming a different `docker` binary.
  //
  // The client does not need repository-provided environment for anything. So
  // the rule is provenance, not name: what the loader wrote from a file the
  // reviewed checkout supplies does not reach the process that decides whether
  // containment happened.
  //
  // Deleting is the right restore, not an approximation of one: the loader
  // records a key as file-sourced only where the real environment had nothing
  // (`isEffectivelyUnset` in config/environment.ts), so a file value never
  // shadows an inherited one and dropping it returns the variable to exactly
  // its pre-load state. The scrub therefore cannot cost the client a `PATH` or
  // `HOME` from the operator's shell — those are set, so they are never
  // file-sourced. What it does cost is a value the operator kept ONLY in a
  // `.env`, which `isFileSourcedEnvKey` cannot tell from the repository's own;
  // that one must move to their shell. Conservative on the right side.
