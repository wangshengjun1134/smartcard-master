// `qwen review cache-commit`: promote a capture's cache candidate into
// `.qwen/review-cache/`, merged with the round's model-written ledger.
//
// The cache used to be hand-written by the model from a JSON template, which
// was fine while it held six scalar fields and a findings list. The content
// anchors changed that: a candidate now carries a per-file map — a hundred
// blob pairs on a real PR — and routing that through model output is a copy
// job models get wrong in ways nobody sees (a dropped entry reads exactly
// like a file that was never captured, and the next round silently
// full-reviews or — worse — trusts a pair that was mangled in transit).
//
// So the merge is mechanical. The candidate (deterministic, written by
// `fetch-pr` or `capture-local` at capture time) provides the anchor fields;
// the ledger file (small, model-written under Step 8's prose rules) provides
// the round's verdict and findings; this command validates both and writes
// the union atomically. Precedence is the security posture: the candidate's
// fields WIN on any key collision, so a ledger cannot overwrite the anchor it
// rides beside — a mis-copied `lastCommitSha` was exactly the class of defect
// the hand-written template invited.
//
// WHETHER to promote stays the model's call, exactly as before: Step 8's
// fail-closed and effort gates decide whether this command runs at all. What
// stops being the model's call is the bytes.
