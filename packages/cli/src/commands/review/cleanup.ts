// Post-review cleanup for /review Step 9.
//   - Audit the PR for writes that bypassed `qwen review submit` (PR targets).
//   - Remove the temporary worktree at .qwen/tmp/review-pr-<n>.
//   - Delete the local branch ref qwen-review/pr-<n>.
//   - Remove any .qwen/tmp/qwen-review-<target>-* side files.
//
// The command is idempotent — missing files / branches are silent OK.

 * opens the third disclosed residual: an EDIT of an UNVOUCHED pre-window

  //   to keep — the CI retry re-captures the plan at the same path, and

  //   refusals write one), but its records predate the retry's fresh plan
  //   capture — nothing clears the record dir between runs. A file older
