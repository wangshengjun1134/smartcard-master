// `qwen review base-tree`: stand up a BUILT tree at the merge base, so a claim
// about changed behaviour can be measured instead of read.
//
// Every other step in this pipeline looks at one tree. The agents read the PR's
// code, the verifier traces a failure scenario through the PR's code, and even
// the probe capability — which does run something — runs it against the PR's
// code alone. The merge base is known (`fetch-pr` resolves `mergeBaseSha`) and
// is used for exactly one thing: choosing the diff range. Nothing has ever built
// it.
//
// That leaves a whole class of claim decided by reading. "This preserves the
// existing output." "This only adds a field." "Cancelled calls looked the same
// as failures before." Each is a statement about the DIFFERENCE between two
// programs, and the review has only ever had one of them in front of it. Reading
// a diff and concluding what the old behaviour was is exactly the step that goes
// wrong quietly: the new lines are always right there and always look correct,
// and whether they change what a user observes routinely turns on code the diff
// never touches.
//
// With a built base tree the same input can be fed to both and the two outputs
// compared. That is a different kind of evidence from anything else here — not a
// stronger argument, but an observation — and it is the only kind that settles a
// disagreement about what a program used to do.
//
// **What this command deliberately does NOT do: run anything.** It creates the
// tree and builds it, which is the expensive, fiddly, failure-prone half (a
// detached worktree at the right SHA, a stale sibling from a crashed run, the
// minimal build set, the widening loop, deadlines that a real build can meet).
// WHAT to run is the reviewer's question, not this command's — it depends
// entirely on the claim under test, and a fixed scenario would fit almost none
// of them. So the report hands back a path and gets out of the way.
//
// Cost is why this is on demand rather than part of every review: the base
// worktree is a cold checkout, so this is an install AND a build. It is worth it for one claim that turns on it and wasted on
// a review with none, which is why the verifier's brief offers it per finding
// instead of the pipeline spending it up front.

 * command rewritten in place under a known key, in a config file that was
 * already readable: whoever can write such a file already chooses what
 * `worktree add`'s own smudge runs, so the window adds nothing to that. Nor
 * does it see a per-worktree `config.worktree` created mid-wait under the
 * common dir's `worktrees/` — the screen does not list that file while it is
 * absent — which lives host-side, outside the mount, where nothing the

/**
 * Whether everything this run RECORDED is still there, unchanged.
 *
 * The comparison iterates `recorded`, and both directions it does not take
 * are deliberate.
 *
 * It used to iterate `current` instead, which caught a rewrite and an
 * addition and missed a DELETION — so removing `dist/cli.js`, the file this
 * module's own docs name as "exactly what a host-side A/B executes", passed
 * the fence and left the base side running against a tree missing its built
 * executable, reading as "fails on base too". That half is closed: every
 * recorded path must still be present with the same stat pair.
 *
 * Then it iterated BOTH, and the addition arm turned out to fire on the
 * pipeline's own sanctioned use. `test-delta` runs the base side with its cwd
 * INSIDE this tree, so the A/B's own cache and coverage output lands here as
 * untracked files; the listing is deliberately unfiltered, so it sees them,
 * and every later shard of the round then declined — measured, three
 * consecutive asks after a single honest A/B, where the pre-fence merge base
 * reused. An `available: false` base tree makes the agent fall back to the
 * path rule, so that decline waves through a real regression in an untouched
 * file. No adversary is involved: it is what an honest round does to itself.
 *
 * So an ADDITION is tolerated HERE, and `executableAddition` takes back the
 * shapes of addition that confer execution — a link, an execute bit, a
 * command on npm's PATH or a package on Node's resolution walk, a package
 * manager's config. What stays tolerated is a plain data file at a new path,
 * and that is a real loss, named rather than papered over: a file some tool
 * LOADS as code, by path or by name, is seen by neither compare — a chunk
 * under `node_modules/.vite/deps`, a `foo.js` beside the `foo/index.js` a
 * CommonJS build left, a test runner's config that outranks the one the
 * build left (`vitest.config.mjs` beside `vite.config.ts`, a
 * `jest.config.js`).
 *
 * It is the lesser loss, for two reasons. The lane dying on every honest
 * round is a total loss of the feature, and an `available: false` base tree
 * makes the agent fall back to the path rule, which waves through exactly
 * the regressions the A/B exists to catch. There is no discriminator: the
 * A/B's base side runs the reviewed repository's own test code IN this tree,
 * so "the run wrote it" and "the reviewed code wrote it" are the same event
 * — re-recording the extras would promote a plant into "what this run
 * built", which is a false statement written into the record itself, and
 * gating on the build lock only discriminates during the build, which is not
 * when the A/B writes. (A third reason used to stand here — that a
 * `node_modules/.bin` one level up outranked anything inside the tree anyway
 * — and it stopped being true when `unfencedResolutionAncestor` began
 * refusing on exactly that ancestor.)
 *
 * So the claim this function makes is stated exactly, and it is the claim
 * the fence can actually keep: what this run BUILT is still here and still
 * what it was. It does not claim the tree holds nothing else. The durable
 * fix for that half is not here — it is for the A/B's base side to run in a
 * throwaway copy of the certified tree rather than in the tree itself, which
 * is `test-delta`'s to make and is filed as follow-up.

      //     in the diff"), and this command's own `--timeout` default (300 s)

      // dependency), or an ancestor `node_modules` inside the mount was on the
      // build's resolution path — the very condition the success path below
