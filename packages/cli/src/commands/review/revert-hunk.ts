// `qwen review revert-hunk`: take ONE hunk of the diff back out of a tree, so
// "is this change load-bearing?" can be measured instead of argued.
//
// The probe answers "does the PR's code exhibit the claimed behaviour", and
// the A/B answers "did the base behave differently". Between them sits a
// question both leave open: whether EACH change in the diff is needed for the
// behaviour the PR claims — the fix that is really two fixes and only one is
// exercised, the hunk that is dead weight, the "refactor" hunk a fix rode in
// on. Maintainer verification answers it the same way every time: revert
// exactly one hunk, re-run the probe that the intact tree passes, and watch
// whether the behaviour reverts with it. The probe pair (intact vs reverted)
// is the witness; a hunk whose revert flips nothing is either not load-bearing
// or the probe is too weak to see it — both worth knowing before an Approve.
//
// The judgment half — WHICH probe to run and what its flip means — stays with
// the verifier. What was hand-done every time, and hand-done wrongly, is the
// mechanical half: extracting hunk N of file F out of a unified diff. By-hand
// extraction means sed ranges over a 5 000-line diff file, and a range that is
// off by one line silently produces a DIFFERENT mutation than the one the
// report claims was tested — the transcription failure this skill has measured
// in every place a hand copies what a command could carry. So this command
// owns: enumerating the diff's hunks under stable ids, extracting one verbatim
// (its file headers and its `\ No newline` markers with it), and applying it
// in REVERSE via git's own patch engine — never a reimplementation of it.
//
// Two facts the report states rather than papering over:
//  - A hunk that will not revert independently (its context overlaps another
//    hunk's edits) is a FACT about the diff's internal coupling, not a failure:
//    "hunk 3 depends on hunk 1" is itself evidence about what is load-bearing.
//  - The tree this runs in should be the verifier's own scratch tree. The
//    command does not know where the shared review worktree is, so it cannot
//    refuse it — but a revert left in the shared tree is exactly the #9207
//    residue class, which is why the brief sends every mutation here through
//    `scratch-tree` first.
