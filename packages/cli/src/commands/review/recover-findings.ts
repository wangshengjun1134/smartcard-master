// Hand a resumed run the interrupted attempt's agent results, from the
// harness's records — never from the orchestrator's memory of them.
//
// A review's findings normally live only in the orchestrator's context: each
// agent returns inline, and no file carries the returns. A resumed run is a
// NEW session, so that context is gone — but the harness's transcripts are
// not, and each one ends with the agent's own final text. This command pairs
// the CLI's prompt records with those transcripts (the same two-author proof
// `check-coverage` runs on) and writes the certified agents' final texts to a
// file the resumed orchestrator reads back.
//
// It is an assessment, not a gate: exit 0 with whatever could be recovered,
// and `check-coverage` remains the authority on what is still owed. The one
// hard failure is missing transcript infrastructure — a resume with no
// evidence to read should say so rather than print an empty recovery.
