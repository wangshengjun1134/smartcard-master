// Against a REAL git repo, because the part that breaks is the worktree
// lifecycle — a detached add at a specific SHA, a stale sibling from a crashed
// run, a path that must sit beside the review worktree rather than inside it.
// None of that is exercised by mocking `spawnSync`, and all of it is what makes
// the command fail on a real review.
//
// The build is the seam. It is the slow half and it has its own suite; what
// matters here is that a base tree only counts as `available` when the build
// actually succeeded, since an A/B against a half-built tree measures the build,
// not the diff.
