// A review roster or selected wave, as a workflow script.
//
// The script has two parts and only one of them varies. `FAN_OUT_BODY` is a
// fixed constant — the dispatch loop, the accounting, the fail-closed guards —
// and `buildReviewWorkflowScript` splices three literals in front of it: the
// roster the CLI computed, the worktree pin, and the subagent type. No logic
// is generated, only data, so the part that can be wrong is the part a test
// can execute.
//
// Why the roster is baked in rather than passed as `args`: the Workflow tool
// takes `args` as INLINE JSON ("Pass actual JSON, not a stringified value")
// and the vm sandbox has no filesystem — its globals are `agent`, `parallel`,
// `pipeline`, `phase`, `log`, `console`, `args`, `budget`, `workflow`, and
// nothing that opens a file. So an args-carried roster is a roster the model
// has to retype into its tool call, which is the failure this whole change
// exists to remove. Baked in, the model's call carries one path and no
// payload.
//
// Sandbox constraints this must respect (workflow-sandbox.ts):
//   - `meta` must be the first statement and a pure literal.
//   - `Date.now()` / `Math.random()` / `new Date()` throw — scripts are
//     deterministic so a resume can replay them.
//   - `parallel()` takes THUNKS and degrades a failed dispatch to a `null`
//     element rather than rejecting.
//
// No template literals in the body below: this file stores script source
// inside host template literals, so a backtick would end one and a `${` would
// splice host state into the script. String concatenation instead,
// deliberately.
