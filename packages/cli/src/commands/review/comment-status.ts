// `qwen review comment-status`: one deterministic pass over a PR's existing
// inline comments, emitting a per-thread status index — anchor validity at the
// live head, whether the anchored file changed in the reviewed worktree since
// the comment was filed (and which commits touched it), reply participation,
// and the blocker signal.
//
// This exists because the questions it answers used to be re-derived by the
// orchestrating model one `gh api` call at a time. Measured on a real
// heavily-discussed PR (#7632, 72 inline comments), a single review run made
// 20+ individual `gh api repos/…/pulls/comments/<id>` fetches — each a whole
// model turn — asking only "is this comment outdated?", "did the code move
// since?", "did anyone answer it?". Those are facts, not judgments; a
// subcommand answers all of them in one call. Bodies are NOT here: they stay
// in the pr-context file, which renders them under its untrusted-data
// preamble with per-comment fetch refs for anything it truncated.
