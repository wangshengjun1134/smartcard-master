// One property, asked of every host-side entrance at once: with a planted
// repository in place, NOTHING the pipeline runs on the host may execute out of
// it.
//
// The gates each entrance carries are asserted in their own suites; this file
// exists because those gates were added one call site at a time, and a class
// closed call site by call site is a class that re-opens at the next call site
// somebody adds. So the fixture here is the attack, not a shape: a coherent
// plant — a rewritten gitfile naming an admin entry whose own `commondir`
// names a planted repository carrying `filter.<x>.clean`, which git EXECUTES
// during an ordinary index refresh — plus a canary file the filter writes on
// the host. Every case asserts the canary is absent afterwards, and the first
// case asserts it is PRESENT when the same command runs ungated, so a fixture
// that quietly stops being an attack fails here rather than certifying the
// gates that walked around it.
