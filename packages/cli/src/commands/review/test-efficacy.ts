// `qwen review test-efficacy`: does the diff's new test actually gate the
// diff's new behaviour?
//
// Agent 5 and the test-coverage matrix ask whether a test EXISTS and whether
// its assertions look like they check something. Neither question can catch the
// two ways a test ships without protecting anything:
//
//   1. UNREACHABLE — the project's test command never runs the file. On PR
//      #6486 the new test lived in `integration-tests/`, which is not an npm
//      workspace, so `npm test --workspaces` never collected it; and its CI job
//      (`Integration Tests (CLI, No Sandbox)`) was skipped. The test executed
//      nowhere, in CI or in review, and nothing noticed.
//   2. INERT — it runs, it passes, and it would still pass with the source
//      change reverted. #6486's did: it drove a kitty CSI-u sequence into a PTY
//      that never negotiated the kitty protocol, so the keypress was discarded
//      before it could reach the handler under test. The test could only ever
//      have caught a startup crash.
//
// Both are decidable without judgment, which is why they live here in TypeScript
// rather than in a review agent's prompt. Findings carry `Source: [test]` and
// are pre-confirmed like Agent 7's — they are the outcome of running commands,
// not of reading code.
//
// The revert probe is the load-bearing half, and its trap is the third outcome:
// reverting the source can make the test fail to COMPILE (it imports a symbol
// the new code introduced). That failure is not evidence the test gates
// anything, and calling it "gated" would be exactly the false assurance this
// command exists to remove. So `gated` requires a real assertion failure, and
// everything else that is not a clean pass is `inconclusive`.
//
// The revert probe is also ALL-OR-NOTHING, and a live dogfood found the gap
// that leaves. A PR's file carried six well-tested behaviours and one untested
// safety statement; reverting the whole file went red on the six — "gated" —
// while deleting just the one statement (a `reminders.clear()` in a
// not-continued branch) left the entire 471-test suite green. The PR's headline
// invariant had zero coverage and both probes were structurally blind to it. So
// a third probe runs statement-level deletion MUTANTS over the diff's added
// lines, restricted to a high-precision set of safety verbs. A mutant the suite
// never notices — a SURVIVOR — is a finding: the invariant that statement
// enforces has no test that would fail without it. The third-outcome discipline
// applies here too: a mutant that breaks the compile is `inconclusive`, never
// `killed`.

 *
 * - `control-failed` — the suite ran and read green, but the positive control
 *   proved the runner could not have gone red, so the reading is not evidence.
 * - `not-run` — no suite ran for it: the tree could not be prepared, or the
 *   runner could not be started at all. Nothing was measured.
 * - `runner-died` — a suite WAS started and did not survive: killed at the
 *   deadline, or by a signal. It may have executed most of its tests, so
 *   "nothing ran" is a claim about it that nothing checked.
 * - `no-output` — the runner ran and produced nothing parseable, so whether it
 *   collected anything is unknown.
 * - `not-in-results` — the run produced results and this file was not among
 *   them. A compile or import error looks like this, and so does a path that
 *   failed to match.
 * - `no-tests` — the file WAS in the results and collected zero assertions.
 * - `all-skipped` — it collected tests and executed none of them.

 * these, and the prose `detail` is written for a human, not for that decision.

 * green — hands every later run a file of its choosing, and the verdict that
 * buys is `killed`: "a test catches this", asserted for statements no test
 * covers. The mirror direction plants a compile error and buys a blanket
 * `inconclusive`.

 * suite can walk around: a `vitest.config.ts` that no zero-config project
 * commits is untracked, is picked up from the runner's cwd, and decides every
 * later run's collection. `-fd` and not `-fdx`, so the borrowed `node_modules`
 * farm and the ignored build output the probes need survive; what an ignored
 * path can still hide is the same blindness the residue probe discloses.
 *
 * Returns null when the tree is as the commit left it, or a reason when it
 * could not be put back — and an ABSENT `.git` is the second kind, not the
 * first. It is the one state the tree can never be restored from, `.git` is
 * an untracked pointer file sitting inside the tree the PR's own suite runs
 * in, and treating "nothing to restore from" as "nothing to restore" hands a
 * guest the whole guarantee for one `rm`. Running the restore anyway is not
 * the alternative: with no `.git`, discovery walks UP and checks the enclosing
