// The base-tree reuse fence's trust state, persisted OUTSIDE the sandbox's
// read-write mount — beside the worktree leases in the global trusted review
// state root.
//
// Every fence decision comes from this file ALONE. The markers inside the
// base tree (`.qwen-review-base-ok`, `.qwen-review-base-failed`) are notes for
// a human looking at the tree, never evidence: the tree is a child of the
// directory the sandbox mounts read-write, so anything stored in it is the
// reviewed code's to forge — a certifying marker can be stamped, and a
// settling one planted to suppress the A/B lane for the whole round while the
// report reads as infrastructure. (That was the nonce-in-marker design's
// hole: the nonce sat in cleartext on line 2, readable from the mount it was
// meant to authenticate against.) What this file records per tree is what a
// mount cannot supply: the base commit the run pinned, whether the build
// succeeded or failed, and the untracked inventory the build legitimately
// left — path, size and ctime per file, so an in-place rewrite of a recorded
// file (`dist/cli.js` is exactly what a host-side A/B executes) is as visible
// as an added one.
//
// One file per plan path, ROTATED IN PLACE on a new run's first ask: the run
// identity lives INSIDE the file, and a caller whose identity disagrees
// replaces the whole file — fresh nonce, records dropped — instead of landing
// on a sibling file keyed to an earlier run's timestamps. With one file there
// is no earlier generation left to adopt, so pinning the plan's timestamps
// (forward or back) cannot hand a later run a state file shaped while the
// reviewed code held the mount; the pin only rotates, and rotation certifies
// nothing.
