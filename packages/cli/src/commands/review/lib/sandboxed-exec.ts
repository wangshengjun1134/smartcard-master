/**
 * Running the reviewed PR's own code behind a container boundary (#9556).
 *
 * A review executes the code it is reviewing. `build-test` runs the commands
 * the reviewed repository's `package.json` names — `npm ci` with its
 * `preinstall`/`postinstall` scripts, the build, the suite — and
 * `test-efficacy` runs that suite again once per baseline, control, mutant,
 * hunk probe and revert. Both did it as the invoking identity, in that
 * identity's environment: measured at the two call sites, the PR's code was
 * handed `process.env` entire, which on CI carries `OPENAI_API_KEY` and
 * `GH_TOKEN`. Reading them is one line in a `postinstall`, and it needs none
 * of the git-config machinery the review pipeline's threat findings are built
 * on.
 *
 * So the boundary goes around the EXECUTIONS, not around the review agent.
 * Wrapping the agent was tried first and is the wrong shape: its secrets do
 * not survive the container's env allowlist, its `timeout` reaps the host-side
 * client rather than the container, its CLI version stops matching the
 * runner's — and after all of it the mount is the whole checkout, so
 * `<repo>/.git` (the `filter.*`, `core.fsmonitor` and `refs/replace` surface)
 * stays writable anyway. Wrapping the commands costs none of that and closes
 * more.
 *
 * Three properties do the work, and each is a decision this module encodes
 * rather than a default it inherits:
 *
 * 1. **The mount is the review temp dir, not the tree the command runs in.**
 *    The dependency farm links OUT of each tree: `exposeDependencies` points
 *    every package in the probe tree's `node_modules` at the review
 *    worktree's copy (measured on a live CI review: 1 722 links). Mounting
 *    one tree would leave all of them dangling. Every tree the pipeline
 *    builds — the review worktree, `-probe`, `-base`, every `-scratch-*` —
 *    is a sibling under `.qwen/tmp`, so one mount covers both ends of every
 *    link while `<repo>/.git` stays outside it.
 * 2. **The environment is an allowlist**, not the inherited one. The PR's
 *    code gets the npm knobs the pipeline sets deliberately and nothing else.
 * 3. **The network is per command kind.** An install needs the registry; a
 *    build and a suite do not. `--network none` keeps loopback, so a suite
 *    that stands up a local fixture server still runs.

/**
 * The image the reviewed repository's commands run in.
 *
 * Defaults to the CLI's own sandbox image, which already carries a Node
 * toolchain — literally the same image `qwen --sandbox` resolves, read from
 * the same manifest field, so a repository that builds under one builds under
 * the other. That sentence was here before `cliSandboxImage` existed, when a
 * hardcoded name made it false; it is now a description of the code rather
 * than an intention about it.
 *
 * The parity is over the DEFAULT, not over every channel `--sandbox` reads.
 * An operator who set `QWEN_SANDBOX_IMAGE` in a user-level `~/.qwen/.env` or
 * in `settings.env` loses it here and falls back to that default: the loader
 * records every key it applies from a file without distinguishing the user's
 * own from the reviewed repository's, and this side cannot afford to guess
 * wrong about which one it is holding. Exporting it in the shell keeps
 * parity. Widening that would mean teaching the loader to carry the
 * home-scoped classification it already computes — a change to the loader,
 * not to this pick.
 *
 * `QWEN_REVIEW_SANDBOX_IMAGE` overrides it for a repository whose toolchain
 * needs more (a JDK, a Python, a specific Node major), which is the case this
 * default cannot cover and should not pretend to.
