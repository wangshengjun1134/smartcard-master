// The deterministic half of `capture-tui`: names, argument shapes, and the
// degradation ladder for terminal-rendering evidence.
//
// A verify agent asked to rule on "the panel clips at 80 columns" has, until
// now, read the layout code and imagined the terminal. Phase 1 gave findings a
// place to carry image evidence (`assetFiles` → `publish-assets`); this file
// and its command are Phase 2's producer: drive the TUI in a throwaway tmux,
// capture what it actually rendered, and hand back files a finding can carry.
//
// Everything here is deterministic so the naming, geometry and ladder rules
// are unit-testable without tmux or freeze; the one filesystem touch is
// verdict-path canonicalization, which falls back to lexical resolution when
// a path does not resolve. The command layer owns the processes.

  // that same cap for the other half of the lifetime: the loop only starts

  // `sleep` and it ran straight into the kill — measured end to end with
  // bash 5.2 as /bin/sh, ONE C-c took pane, session and server down and the
  // capture refused `no server running` with zero artifacts, while the same
  // run with this trap captured its marker. (dash does not reproduce it, so
  // a dash-only probe would have missed it.) `trap ''` is SIG_IGN and
  // inherits across exec, but nothing here execs anything but `sleep`, so
  // the captured command keeps its own Ctrl-C behaviour. MANY SHORT periods,
  // not a few long ones: each post-exit signal consumes the period it
  // interrupts, so with three hour-long sleeps the three C-c tokens this
  // command explicitly supports exhausted the whole budget MID-CAPTURE —
  // pane, session and server gone before capture-pane ran, refusing
  // `tmux failed mid-capture: no server running` (measured 5/5 on
