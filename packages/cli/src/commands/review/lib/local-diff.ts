// Capture the working tree's diff for a local /review — staged, unstaged, AND
// untracked.
//
// Why the third one is not a nicety: `git diff HEAD` reports changes to files
// git already tracks. A file the user created and has not `git add`ed is in
// neither the index nor HEAD, so it appears in **no** `git diff` output at all.
// The review therefore skipped brand-new files entirely — a new payment path, a
// new auth middleware, the whole file invisible — and when the new file was the
// *only* change, /review reported "no changes to review" and stopped.
//
// The fix must not fix it by staging things. `git add -N` would make untracked
// files show up in `git diff HEAD`, and it would do so by **writing to the
// user's index** — the same class of side effect the mandatory-worktree rule
// exists to prevent. Every new file would silently become a tracked, staged
// path in the user's repo because they asked for a code review. So each
// untracked file is diffed against `/dev/null` with `--no-index`, which touches
// nothing, and the sections are concatenated onto the tracked diff. A unified
// diff is a concatenation of per-file sections; the result parses exactly like
// any other.

 * - A **symlink to a directory** arrives as a plain name and resolves the same
 *   way, which is why `lstat` alone cannot judge it and this follows the link
 *   before deciding.
 * - A **symlink to a file** is diffable and must pass: git renders the *link

 *   — the link text does not depend on the target existing — and it is worth
