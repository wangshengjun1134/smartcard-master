// `tryStat` asks for `{ bigint: true }` so a 64-bit NTFS file index arrives
// EXACT rather than rounded at the JS boundary. With a number-backed
// `Stats`, an id above 2^53 loses precision — two distinct files can
// surface with an equal `ino` — which is why this comparison used to refuse
// such ids (via the shared `hasVerifiableInode` safe-integer predicate) and
// degrade to canonical spellings: a fail-open for hard-link aliases, which
// no spelling comparison can see through (#11848). Under bigint stats the
// id is exact end to end, so dev/ino decides whenever the volume reports an
// id at all. The shared predicate module is deliberately left untouched —
// its number-typed contract is still what the conversation-identity checks
// consume, and core's looser predicate (`Number(ino) !== 0`) stays as-is so
// `assertVerifiableTranscriptIdentity` does not flip on >2^53 Windows
// transcript inodes.
//
// The non-zero rule inside `isSameFile` below is therefore a deliberate
// LOCAL restatement, listed in the lockstep ledger at that predicate's
// declaration site (utils/conversation-directory-identity.ts). Core's
// bigint-tolerant `hasVerifiableInode` (core/src/utils/file-identity.ts)
// states the same rule and would be equivalent here; it is not imported
// because this helper is a leaf that imports only node builtins, and one
// comparison does not justify coupling it to core.

 * component on the way to the file. Stats are taken with `{ bigint: true }`,

 * unverifiable case left is a volume reporting no id at all (`ino === 0`:
 * FAT/exFAT/SMB-style), where comparing ids would collapse unrelated files
 * onto one identity — there the comparison falls back to canonical
 * spellings, losing hard-link identity but never equating distinct files.
 * Where a side is absent, the deepest existing ancestor is canonicalised
 * instead, keeping the comparison honest for files a command is about to
