// The plan-time reading of the round's posting posture (#10104).
//
// The posting floor itself resolves at compose time, where the previous
// posted round's number is in hand (`floorResolvesCritical`). But by then
// the round's SHAPE is spent: a re-review that was always going to post
// Criticals only has already run the full territory fan-out and the
// full-width reverse-audit waves over territory whose sub-Critical yield the
// floor defers wholesale. Measured on one long-lived PR, that shape cost a
// 3h13m round whose entire finder fan-out contributed nothing postable.
//
// So the capture command predicts the resolution from the same facts compose
// will read — the CLI-recorded invocation floor and the side file
// `pr-context` persisted — and predicts ONLY off the monotone arms, so the
// prediction cannot outrun the resolution:
//
// - an explicit/configured `critical` floor resolves `critical` at compose
//   unconditionally;
// - the round arm (`thisRound >= CRITICAL_FLOOR_ROUND`) reads the side
//   file's round, which is what compose's `prevRound` reads, and rounds
//   only grow — except that this reader also refuses a round the file
//   records as unattributed (see `resolveCriticalPosture`), where compose's
//   floor still engages on it: the prediction may under-claim, never
//   outrun;
// - the flat-trend arm reads the recorded streak: at or past
//   `FLAT_STREAK_TO_ENGAGE` compose's latch holds engagement on the recorded
//   value alone ("the pin is the latch"), so a streak at the bar today is a
//   floor resolved `critical` at compose.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT predict: a streak one measurement short of
// the bar (compose may advance it this round — this prediction stays
// conservative and the round keeps the full shape), and this round's own
// explicit `--severity-floor suggestion`, which reaches this reading through
// the same recorded invocation and turns the posture off. Every doubt state
// — no side file, an unreadable one, a round it cannot place — reads as "no
// posture", which is the ordinary full round.
//
// The alignment is closed from the other side too: the plan record this
// prediction produces is itself an arm of compose's floor resolution
// (`floorResolvesCritical`'s fix-audit arm), so even where compose cannot
// re-derive the arms this read predicted from — a context-unavailable
// round, a side file rewritten in between — the posting bar follows the
// shape the round already ran, and an explicit `suggestion` floor at
// compose still wins.
