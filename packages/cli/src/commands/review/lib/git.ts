/**
 * The launch directory, judged once per directory this process runs git from.
 *
 * Every wrapper below runs git with NO `cwd`, so each one discovers its
 * repository from `process.cwd()` — and in the nested geometry `mountRootFor`
 * documents, that directory is a review worktree inside the OUTER review's
 * read-write mount, where the reviewed code can rewrite the `.git` pointer git
 * follows. What the individual commands then do through it is not a short list:
 * `fetch` loads the plant's transport config, `diff` refreshes the index and
 * honours `diff.<driver>.command`, `show <base>:<path>` hands back the plant's
 * content as this review's own rules, `remote get-url` names where a submission
 * goes. Gating those command by command is how this class kept re-opening, so
 * the question is asked HERE, at the four functions every one of them goes
 * through.
 *
 * A `-C <tree>` argument does not change the answer's relevance: that scopes
 * the command to another tree, and THAT tree's pointer is the subject of
 * `untrustedGitfile`, which its callers ask separately. This one is only ever
 * about where the process stands.
 *
 * Only the NEGATIVE is memoized, and only where repeating it costs nothing:
 * outside a review temp dir `untrustedRepositoryFrom` returns on its first line
 * — a string scan, no spawn — so caching that keeps `gitProbe`, called per
 * thread by `comment-status`, off a per-call syscall and an ordinary checkout
 * never pays for this gate at all.
 *
 * The memo's key is the LEXICAL marker scan, never `mountRootFor`'s answer.
 * That null is overloaded (see `insideReviewTmpLexically`), and the rename
 * attack turns on the difference: `mv .qwen .qwen-real` from inside the outer
 * mount leaves the live cwd's stale spelling matching the marker while the
 * mount stops answering, so a memo keyed on "no mount root" recorded TRUSTED
 * for a spelling inside the review temp dir — and served it to whatever tree
 * the same spelling was later stood back up over, filter-carrying gitfile
 * included. A spelling that carries the marker is therefore NEVER memoized:
 * inside a review temp dir the question is RE-ASKED on every call.
 *
 * The rename attack's premise is worth naming precisely: after an ancestor
 * rename, `process.cwd()` serves the PRE-rename spelling not because of any
 * kernel property — Linux `getcwd(2)` follows renames — but because Node
 * caches the cwd (`cachedCwd`) until an in-process `chdir` invalidates it.
 * So the one thing that re-opens the window on every platform is a future
 * `process.chdir` in this process while the outer phase holds the mount:
 * today no production review code chdirs after startup (grep it before
 * adding one), and the canary pins the premise by asserting the stale
 * spelling right after the rename. That is not the TOCTOU residual this
 * design documents and does not close, which is about a pointer rewritten
 * between a check and its own use: here the OUTER review's containerized
 * build/test phase holds the directory read-write for the length of a whole
 * command, so it rewrites the pointer BETWEEN calls, and a verdict memoized
 * for the process served the first clean answer to every later wrapper —
 * `status` refreshing the plant's index and running its clean filter, `show
 * <base>:<path>` handing the plant's content back as this review's own
 * rules. `fetch-pr` asks twice for the same reason; this asks every time,
 * and the spawn it costs exists only in the one geometry where the gate
 * speaks.

  // follow-up prune cleared the stale registration over the rmSync'd path.
