// May this run continue the interrupted one, or must it start over?
//
// The ruling is pure: `fetch-pr --resume` gathers the probes (git, gh, file
// hashes, the resume marker) and this function only compares them. Every
// check fails toward a FRESH run — resuming on stale state would continue a
// review of code nobody is reviewing anymore, which is strictly worse than
// re-fetching. The checkpoint key is content (the diff's sha256, the head
// SHA), never a path or a timestamp: input that changed re-runs, by
// construction rather than by invalidation logic.
//
// Resume is a LOCAL convenience: a developer whose `qwen review` was
// interrupted re-runs it with `--resume`. The on-disk state was written by
// the trusted CLI and the developer — there is no adversarial attempt-1 code
// racing the same disk (CI does not resume; its trigger runs fresh), so the
// ruling asks only whether the state is genuinely UNCHANGED and resumable,
// not whether a report field was forged. Every check still fails toward a
// FRESH run: resuming stale state reviews code nobody is reviewing anymore.
