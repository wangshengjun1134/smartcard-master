 * round follows it (R10-3). `.qwen/*` is gitignored, so nothing else ever
 * shows the surviving link to anyone.
 *
 * Keyed on `isSymbolicLink()`, never on mere existence: the round's side
 * files and worktrees are real files and directories that legitimately
 * exist from the last round. Two name classes, because the directory is
 * shared (the skill-args file, a model's intermediates): every
 * `qwen-review-*` entry, walked in full — side files, and the per-target
 * directories the round writes INTO, where a link one level down is the
 * same redirect — and the worktree names, checked at their own entry only:
 * inside a worktree the links are the checkout's own (`node_modules`), and
 * a redirected worktree root is the one that matters. Case-folded like the
 * index sweep, for the same case-insensitive filesystem.
 *
 * The directory is shared by concurrent reviews, so an entry listed a moment
 * ago can be gone (another target's `cleanup`) or replaced by a file: that
 * is "nothing here", not a failure. Any other listing error refuses under
 * the command's name — a directory this cannot list is one it cannot clear.
