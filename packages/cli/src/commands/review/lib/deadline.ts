// The reverse-audit loop's clock.
//
// The iterative reverse audit (Step 5) is the one stage of a review whose cost
// is open-ended: each round is a fan-out (one auditor per chunk on a 3B plan),
// each round's findings go back through verification, and the loop runs until
// two consecutive dry rounds or the plan's round cap (one value per topology:
// 10 on a 3A diff, 5 on a 3B one, and 3 when huge — but only under an EXPLICIT
// clock, CI's epoch or `--deadline`, since that reduction answers a ceiling;
// 5 when huge under the plan's default wall). On a PR where every round
// finds something, that is the whole budget. Measured on a real CI run
// (#8368, +1699 lines): the audit loop ran to the 5-round cap, consumed 3.5 of
// the job's 4 budgeted hours, and the outer GNU-timeout kill arrived while
// round 5's findings were still being verified — the review died holding
// every confirmed finding it had, and nothing reached the pull request.
//
// So a time-budgeted run tells the CLI its deadline, and the round *builder*
// refuses to start a round that no longer fits. Two quantities have to fit,
// not one: the tail (the last verification, compose-review, submission — the
// reserve) AND the round being admitted, whose cost the gate now measures
// instead of guessing — the loop's terminal round is by construction the one
// that starts closest to the boundary, so a gate that admits a round on the
// reserve alone re-creates the killed-mid-verification failure one round wide.
// Each admission is stamped on disk; the next admission reads the previous
// stamp and uses the observed round cost, falling back to a conservative
// constant for round 1 (which starts with the most headroom).
//
// The refusal is deterministic twice over: the builder exits 4 with no prompt
// built (there is no round to launch without it), and a `budget-stop.json`
// marker is written beside the prompt records so `compose-review` synthesizes
// the verdict-capping disclosure itself — the orchestrator's copy of the
// entry is a courtesy to the terminal reader, not the mechanism.
//
// Where the deadline comes from, in order: the environment's epoch when CI
// exports one; else the wall the plan recorded at capture — a `--deadline
// <minutes>`, or the topology's own default (8h/12h/16h by tier) — added to
// the CURRENT attempt's start, so a `--resume` that starts a new attempt (a
// fresh session) renews it; else nothing, when
// the capture was told `--deadline none`. So a local run now has a wall too,
// and it is a LIVENESS bound: sized above what a healthy run at the round
// cap spends, so it bites only a loop that has stopped converging. The huge
// tier's round reduction keys on an EXPLICIT clock (env or flag), never on
// the default — see `hasReviewDeadline`.
// A malformed value fails OPEN at its own level: a broken environment
// variable falls through to the plan's wall, a broken plan field to no wall
// (the gate stays silent; the outer kill still bounds the run) — never a
// wedge of every budgeted review at round 1.

 * launches WITH the next round's auditors instead of sitting between
 * admissions — so the admission-to-admission span the gate measures
 * contains no verification pass, and the terminal round's verification has
 * exactly one cover: this reserve. That makes the reserve's sizing the
 * whole margin, not a top-up on an overlap the measurement already
 * carried — so the estimate refuses to be optimistic too: it prices the
 * round from the COSTLIEST span the run has measured (see
 * `expectedRoundSeconds`), because round costs do not climb smoothly —
 * each round re-reads the diff against a longer findings list, and a
 * repair relaunch lands mid-loop and makes one round the expensive one —
 * and the newest span alone under-predicts the next in exactly the runs
 * that end near the boundary. Over-reserving ends the loop at most one
 * round early, disclosed as a budget stop; under-reserving is #8368 —
 * killed mid-verification, holding every confirmed finding.
 *
 * Sized from the only tail measurement the record holds (#8368, +1699
 * lines): the loop ended with half an hour left and the outer kill found
 * round 5's verification STILL RUNNING — the tail had consumed more than 30
 * minutes and was nowhere through (compose, anchor resolution and
 * submission never started). No upper bound was ever measured, so the size
 * is insurance, not arithmetic: pipelining made this reserve the terminal
 * round's ONLY cover, and until pipelined runs measure their tails, the
 * reserve buys the unknown, not the known. Over-reserving ends the loop at
 * most one round early, disclosed as a budget stop; under-reserving is
 * #8368.
 *
 * This is only the fallback: the budget itself is
 * chosen outside the CLI (a repository variable, a workflow input, a
 * `/review --timeout=N` comment), so the review workflow passes a reserve
 * scaled to the budget it resolved rather than trusting this constant to fit
 * an arbitrary one. The workflow caps that scaled reserve at this same
 * number (`.github/workflows/qwen-code-pr-review.yml`) — keep the two in
 * sync. A wall the PLAN carries gets the same scaling in-process
