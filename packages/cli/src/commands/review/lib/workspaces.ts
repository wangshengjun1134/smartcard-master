// Which packages a diff actually touches, and what a review must therefore build.
//
// Agent 7 was told, in prose, to run `npm run build` and then `npm test`, each
// with a 120-second timeout. Measured against the harness's own subagent
// transcripts: **139 command timeouts across 89 review sessions, 71 of them
// `npm run build`**. On this repo the full build takes 98 seconds with a warm
// tree and longer from the cold one a review works in, so the command the skill
// mandates is one that cannot finish inside the deadline the skill sets. Every
// high-effort review spent two minutes on it, learned nothing, and then spent
// several more model turns discovering the timeout, deciding it was
// "environmental", and improvising a narrower command — which is the command it
// should have been handed.
//
// A two-file PR in one package does not need the other fifteen built. The plan
// report already names every changed file and the root `package.json` already
// names the workspaces, so the scope is *derivable*. It is derived here, in code,
// rather than left to an agent to rediscover under a deadline it cannot meet.
//
// Scope is deliberately widened in one direction: a changed workspace's
// **dependents** are built too. A change to a package everything imports can only
// break its consumers at their compile, and a build that skipped them would
// report a green compile for code it never compiled. Narrowing to the changed
// package alone would be fast and wrong; that is the trade this module refuses.
