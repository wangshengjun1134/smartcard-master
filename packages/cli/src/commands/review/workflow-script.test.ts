// The generated script is executed here, not merely parsed — which is the

// Every case below runs the REAL output of `buildReviewWorkflowScript`, so a
// roster that serialized wrong would fail these as surely as a broken loop.
//
// The harness mirrors the runtime's execution shape (workflow-sandbox.ts)
// rather than importing it — `createWorkflowSandbox` is not exported from
// the core package, and exporting it for this test would be a cross-package
// change for no gain in what is being checked:
//   - the meta block is STRIPPED, never executed: the sandbox parses it as
//     a pure literal, so no live `meta` binding may reach the body;
//   - the body runs inside the runtime's strict-mode async IIFE wrapper, so
//     an undeclared assignment throws here like it throws at dispatch;
//   - the body runs in a vm context binding only the globals this harness
//     stands in for — a host-only global like `setTimeout` fails here like
//     it fails in the sandbox;
//   - the `agent` stub applies the runtime's option gates.
// What it does not mirror: the sandbox's throwing Date/Math replacements
// (a fresh vm context has a real Date, so the determinism case asserts on
// the source instead) and the meta literal parser (not exported from the
// core package; the meta block's purity is asserted on the source below).
//
// The runtime's option allowlist (workflow-sandbox.ts): a key outside it is
// a typo the sandbox refuses at dispatch, so it must be refused here.
