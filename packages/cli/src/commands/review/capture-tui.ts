// `qwen review capture-tui`: run a command in a throwaway terminal and hand
// back what it actually rendered — the evidence producer for rendering claims.
//
// A verifier ruling on "the panel clips at 80 columns" without this command
// reads the layout code and imagines a terminal; measured on this repo, the
// imagining is where rendering verdicts go wrong. This command makes the
// terminal real and the evidence a file:
//
//   tmux (PRIVATE server, -L)  →  .ans (pane text with escapes, always)
//                              →  .png (freeze-rendered, when available)
//
// The safety property is isolation, and it is structural: every tmux call is
// scoped to a per-run private server socket, so the capture cannot see —
// let alone resize or kill — the user's own tmux sessions. The measured
// failure mode of desktop-automation verification was exactly "drives the
// user's own windows"; a private server makes that impossible rather than
// discouraged. `kill-server` at the end reaps the server, the session, the
// holder and everything still attached to the pane — which is everything a
// normal command leaves behind. It is NOT a process-tree reaper: a command
// that DAEMONIZES (setsid, `spawn(..., {detached: true}).unref()`, a TUI
// that forks a browser or updater helper) puts its descendant in a new
// session, and no portable kill reaches it — measured, with a control arm:
// the detached grandchild outlived the reap, the attached one did not.
// Nothing links that process back to the capture afterwards either (its
// parent is already init), so guessing at it would kill the wrong pid.
// Capture such commands only when you are prepared to reap their daemons
// yourself.
//
// WHAT THIS COMMAND GUARANTEES ABOUT FILES, and what it does not.
//
// It guarantees, against ordinary conditions — a re-used --out, a stale
// artifact from a previous run, an unrelated file that happens to hold one
// of the names, a concurrent capture on a different --out, a host that runs
// out of descriptors or disk mid-run:
//
//   · it never writes over, or deletes, a file it cannot show a previous
//     run of THIS command wrote (manifest signature: the evidence rung, the
//     absolute ansPath it recorded, and a settledBy from the closed set);
//   · it never credits bytes it did not produce as this run's evidence;
//   · it refuses rather than hangs, crashes, or half-writes — every refusal
//     is exit 3, a reason on stderr, and machine-readable JSON on stdout;
//   · it leaves no tmux server, session, or holder behind, for everything
//     that stays in the capture's own session (see the reap comment for the
//     one documented exception: commands that daemonize a descendant).
//
// It does NOT guarantee any of that against an ACTIVE adversary sharing the
// uid — a process deliberately racing this one to swap files, symlinks, or
// directories between a check and the syscall that follows it. Node exposes
// no *at() syscalls (openat/unlinkat against a directory descriptor), so
// every path here resolves BY NAME, and a name can be redirected in the
// interval no userspace check can close. Hardening against that model is
// real work with its own guarantees and its own tests; it is deliberately
// NOT this file's claim, and a finding of that shape is a feature request
// against a stated non-goal rather than a defect against this contract.
//
// The practical boundary: an actor able to win those races already shares
// the uid, and can read the .ans, edit the source tree under review, or
// replace the reviewing binary outright. This command is not the weak link
// in that scenario, and pretending otherwise would buy a false guarantee.
//
// Degradation is explicit, not silent: the manifest names which evidence rung
// was reached (`png` or `ans-only`) and why, because a verifier must say
// which rung its verdict stands on — a PNG is publishable rendering evidence,
// an .ans proves bytes but not pixels, and prose is neither. A REFUSED
// capture writes no manifest at all — the bottom rung (`none`) is reported by
// the refusal JSON on stdout instead, so a missing manifest reads as a
// refusal, not corruption.
