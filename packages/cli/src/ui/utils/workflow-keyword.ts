/**
 * @fileoverview P7-trigger: the `workflow` keyword trigger. When a user's
 * prompt mentions `workflow` (as a whole word), the turn is softly steered
 * toward the Workflow tool by prepending a system reminder. This is the
 * qwen-code analogue of upstream's keyword opt-in — deliberately keyed on the
 * plain word `workflow` (never any other marker).
 *
 * The reminder also says where the authoring reference is, because the Workflow
 * tool's description no longer carries it. It names the reference; it does not
 * carry it. The prefix becomes part of the user's own message — rendered in the
 * transcript, restored into the input buffer when a queued turn is cancelled,
 * kept in history on every later request — and a skill body travelling that way
 * would miss everything a real Skill load gets: dedup on resume, `/context`
 * attribution, microcompaction, and the skill's declared side effects.
