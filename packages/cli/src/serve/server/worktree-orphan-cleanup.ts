 * scan instead.
 *
 * The sidecar is an untrusted input class (crash-truncated or

 * allow-list and select the removal target are validated here, before
 * either one is trusted: both must be absolute, and when the runtime's
 * own workspace cwd is supplied they must belong to that workspace —
 * `workspaceCwd` must realpath to it exactly and `originalCwd` must be
 * the workspace or its repo top-level, the same pair the sibling
 * routes accept. Any doubt preserves the checkout with a named log
 * line; the session record deletion itself is never blocked.
