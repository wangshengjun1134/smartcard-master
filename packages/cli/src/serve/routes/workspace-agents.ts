/**
 * Read and write surface behind the Web Shell agents-and-threads pages.
 *
 * Three properties this layer is responsible for, none of which the client
 * can hold on its own:
 *
 * 1. **The thread's state is decided here.** `resolveThreadStatus` returns the
 *    status *and* the sentence explaining it, and both travel to the client
 *    together. A browser that derived its own status word would give the
 *    product two answers to "why is this blocked", and the one on screen would
 *    win.
 * 2. **Routing is previewed with the real rules.** The composer shows who a
 *    draft will wake before it is sent. That preview runs `parseMentions` and
 *    `decideDispatch` — the same pure functions admission uses — so it is the
 *    true outcome rather than a second implementation that can drift.
 * 3. **Human identity comes from the authenticated surface**, never from the
 *    request body. A post from this route is authored by the person operating
 *    the shell; there is no field they can set to claim otherwise.
