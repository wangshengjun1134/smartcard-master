/**
 * Workflow refusals the ACP child reports with `data.errorKind`, and the HTTP
 * status each is answered with. None is a daemon fault, so each keeps its
 * message instead of collapsing into an internal error:
 *
 * - `workflow_invalid_params`: the request's own input was rejected.
 * - `workflow_args_unavailable`: a run from history was launched with `args`
 *   too large for its snapshot to keep, so it cannot be started again as the
 *   same run.
 * - `workflow_journal_unavailable`: a retry has no journal to resume; a rerun
 *   starts the run from the beginning.
 * - `workflow_run_live_elsewhere`: the run's checkpoint records a process that
 *   has not been seen to exit, so a retry would be the second runner on its
 *   journal.
 * - `workflow_not_recorded`: a retry could not record that the run is running
 *   again, which is what keeps another process from starting it a second
 *   time, so it did not start.
