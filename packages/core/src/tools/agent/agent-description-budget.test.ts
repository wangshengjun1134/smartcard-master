/**
 * Per-turn size budgets for the Agent tool's model-visible surface.
 *
 * Every character of a tool's description and parameter schema is sent on
 * every request, so each has a budget — the discipline
 * `workflow.test.ts` already applies to the Workflow tool, under the same
 * reasoning quoted in `skills/workflow-authoring-skill.ts`: "only the turn
 * that actually writes a script needs it, while a tool description is paid
 * for on every turn."
 *
 * Agent needs this more than Workflow did, because its description is
 * assembled at runtime: `refreshSubagents()` appends the live subagent-type
 * catalogue, and two optional blocks come and go with
 * `isAgentTeamEnabled()` / `isTodoWriteEnabled()`. Nothing measured that,
 * so the surface could grow release over release without any signal (#12054).
 *
 * The budgets below are set from measurement plus a paragraph of headroom,
 * not from a target: one legitimate clause fits, a block of prose pasted
 * back does not. Raising one is a normal part of a change that adds
 * guidance — moving it without noticing is what this pins.
