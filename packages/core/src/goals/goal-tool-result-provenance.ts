 * How a finished tool call should be recorded, so its result can become Goal

 *
 * The evidence catalog derives a record's provenance from the Goal permit
 * stamped on it (`goal-evidence.ts`: no parsed goal context, no provenance,
 * no catalog entry). A tool result recorded without the stamp is therefore
 * invisible to the catalog -- and since `tool_result` is the only provenance
 * that maps to `external_fact`, an unstamped host produces a Goal that can
 * never prove anything about the world: completions citing only the model's
 * own words are refused by the verifier, and the `infeasible` and `external`
 * blockers, which require external evidence, are unreachable.
 *
 * `get_goal` and `update_goal` are stamped as `goal_runtime` instead: they are
 * the Goal's own bookkeeping, and a catalog that cited its own reads as proof
 * would be circular. `exec` is `execution_output`: the script can rewrite
 * nested results, so only the separately recorded originals attest tool facts.
 *
 * Every site that records tool results during a Goal turn routes through
 * here -- the interactive scheduler, both TUI recording paths, headless, and
 * ACP -- so the rule cannot drift between them.
