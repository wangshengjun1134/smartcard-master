 * (or does not) from that record, and the older card is history. A newest
 * card that is terminal (`achieved`, `cleared`, ...) means the legacy run
 * ended. Only when the newest Goal record of either kind is a running card
 * is there a Goal the card claims to be running and nothing driving it.
 *
 * `setAt` is carried from the `set` card that opened the run, since only
 * `set` cards were written with one. The walk back stops at a card of
 * another kind or another condition, and at a `goal_state` record: two runs
 * can sit back to back with no terminal card between them, and the
 * condition is what identifies the run.
 *
 * Read for presentation only: the session list's label and the trailing
 * card an ACP replay emits so the running card is not the last word.
