/**
 * @fileoverview How a tool reaches a bundled reference skill in this session.
 *
 * Long guidance that only one turn in a session needs — how to write a
 * workflow script, how to brief a subagent — belongs in a bundled skill rather
 * than in a tool description, because a description is paid for on every turn
 * while a skill body is paid for when it is loaded. That trade only works if
 * the tool knows which of four situations it is in:
 *
 * - The model can load the skill. Point at it.
 * - The Skill tool's schema can be withheld by a `tools.eager` allowlist, so
 *   the model reaches it through the tool_search + tool_call bridge. Point at
 *   it and say so.
 * - The model has no route to any skill (skills are off, the Skill tool is
 *   denied, or it is deferred with no tool_search + tool_call bridge to reach
 *   it). Inline the reference, or the guidance reaches nobody.
 * - The user turned this reference off, by name or by disabling the whole
 *   bundled level. Carry neither: inlining would put back, at a higher
 *   per-turn price, exactly the text they asked to remove.
 *
 * Extracted from the `workflow-authoring` implementation (#11013) when the
 * Agent tool needed the same decision (#12054), so the two cannot drift.
 * Each tool decides once, when it is constructed, and records the answer.
