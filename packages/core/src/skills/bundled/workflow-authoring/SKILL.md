# Workflow authoring reference

Everything below is about _writing_ the script. Whether a workflow may run at
all is decided by the Workflow tool's own opt-in rule — this reference does
not authorize a run.

Reach for one to be comprehensive (decompose the work and cover every part in
parallel), to be confident (independent perspectives and adversarial checks
before an answer is committed to), or to take on scale a single context cannot
hold — migrations, audits, broad sweeps. The script is where that structure is
encoded: what fans out, what verifies, what synthesizes. Parallelism on its own
is not a reason; work that is already one short sequence of edits belongs in
the main loop.

## Scout first, then orchestrate

The strongest pattern is hybrid: discover the work list in the main loop (list
the files, scope the diff, read the failing test), then hand that list to a
workflow. You do not need to know the shape of the work before the task — only
before the orchestration step. When the work has distinct phases, run several
small workflows across turns and read each result before choosing the next,
rather than authoring one large script that runs unattended.

Common single-phase shapes: understand (parallel readers over subsystems,
merged into one map), design (independent approaches, judged, then
synthesized), review (dimensions, find, verify each finding), research (broad
sweep, deep read, synthesis), migrate (discover sites, transform each under
`isolation: 'worktree'`, verify).

## Script contract

The source is wrapped as an async IIFE, so top-level `await` and a top-level
`return` are both legal — and a trailing expression is _not_ a return value.
End every successful path with an explicit `return`.

It is plain JavaScript, not TypeScript, and it cannot `import` anything. A
script with a dynamic `import()` anywhere in it — even in a branch that never
runs — is refused before it starts, so none of its agents runs first; do file,
network, and package work inside an agent instead.

The script may start with a literal `export const meta = {...}` declaration
with `name`, `description`, and optionally `whenToUse` and
`phases: [{ title, detail? }]`. It must be a pure literal — no variables,
calls, or interpolation — and it is stripped before execution, so nothing in
the script body can read it. Fields outside that list are dropped. The
approval dialog prints the name, the description, and each phase title with
its `detail` as a one-line explanation beside it: give every phase a `detail`,
because for a run that may dispatch hundreds of agents it is what the user
reads before approving. In a workflow an extension ships, `whenToUse` also lists
the workflow for the model to start when a request matches it; leave it out and
the workflow runs only when someone asks for it by name.

Injected globals, and nothing else:

- `phase(title)` — open a phase. Everything dispatched afterwards is attributed
  to it in the live phase tree, until the next phase opens.
- `log(msg)` — one line into the run log the user watches.
- `agent(prompt, opts?)` — dispatch one subagent. See **agent() options**.
- `parallel(thunks)` — run thunks through the shared concurrency window,
  resolving to a position-aligned array. `parallel()` itself rejects on
  invalid arguments.
- `pipeline(items, ...stages)` — run each item through the stages
  independently. See **Default to `pipeline()`**.
- `workflow(nameOrRef, args?, { stepId }?)` — run a saved workflow inline. See **Saved
  workflows and workflow()**.
- `args` — the structured value the caller passed, or `undefined`.
- `budget` — `{ total, spent(), remaining() }`. See **Scaling to the token
  budget**.

Pass THUNKS to `parallel()`, not eager calls: `parallel([() => agent(...)])`,
not `parallel([agent(...)])`. The eager form is refused outright: a
non-function element rejects the whole batch, and by then every `agent()` in it
has already been admitted, counted against the caps, and spent — with its
result discarded.

Each list a single call takes — the thunks of `parallel()`, and the items and
the stages of `pipeline()` — holds at most 4096 entries. A longer list rejects
the whole call before any of its thunks or stages runs; it is never truncated.
Like any invalid argument, that rejection can be caught, and inside an outer
`parallel()`/`pipeline()` it becomes that slot's `null`. The limit is per call,
not per run: split a larger input into batches of thunks and await each in
turn. Batching does not lift the agent cap or the token budget.

```js
const thunks = files.map((file) => () => agent(`Summarize ${file}`));
let summaries = [];
for (let i = 0; i < thunks.length; i += 4096) {
  summaries = summaries.concat(await parallel(thunks.slice(i, i + 4096)));
}
```

A script must be deterministic so a resume replays the same call sequence.
`Math.random()` throws, and so does all of `Date` — `Date()`, `new Date()`,
`Date.now()`, `Date.parse()` and `Date.UTC()` alike. Pass timestamps in via
`args`, or stamp the result after the workflow returns. A script that calls any
of them is refused before it starts, so none of its agents runs first.

Scripts run in a `node:vm` sandbox with no filesystem, shell, network, or
environment access. All I/O happens through the prompts you give the agents, so
say explicitly what each one should read and whether it may edit files.

## agent() options

`agent(prompt, { stepId?, label?, phase?, schema?, model?, effort?, agentType?, isolation?, workingDir?, stallMs?, disallowedTools?, tools? })`

- `stepId` (string, ≤128 chars) — optional caller node ID; does not affect caching. Also accepted in `workflow()` options.
- `label` (string) — display name in run views and failures.
  Make it unique per dispatch to distinguish failures.
- `phase` (string) — opens a named phase at this call, exactly as `phase(title)`
  would: this dispatch and every dispatch issued after it are attributed to that
  phase. It is not scoped to the one call, so in a fan-out open phases with
  `phase()` between groups rather than per dispatch.
- `schema` (JSON Schema object) — the subagent must deliver its result by
  calling `structured_output` with arguments matching the schema; agent()
  resolves to the validated object. A schema that does not compile, or that
  requires a property its own object forbids, makes agent() resolve to null
  without starting the agent. Each failed submission hands its error back to
  the agent, and the third failed submission stops it. With no valid result
  agent() resolves to null and the failure states how many submissions failed
  and the last error; check for null.
- `agentType` (string) — resolves against the declarative-agents registry
  (`.qwen/agents/<name>.md`, project then user then built-in). Unresolved names
  make the admitted agent() resolve to null and record "agent({agentType}):
  agent type 'X' not found"; check for null.
- `model` (string) — per-call model override; routes provider correctly via the
  subagent runtime view.
- `effort` (`'low'` | `'medium'` | `'high'` | `'xhigh'` | `'max'`) — the
  reasoning effort for this one agent. It is limited to the tiers `/effort`
  offers for the agent's model or, for a model whose settings declare none, to
  the tiers its provider's built-in table accepts: a tier the model does not
  offer becomes the next stronger tier it does offer, or its strongest tier
  when none is stronger. A model that offers no tiers, or thinking turned off
  for the session or the model, leaves the agent with the effort it would have
  had without the option. The session's own effort is never changed, and an
  explicit tier replaces any thinking budget the agent would otherwise inherit;
  a thinking setting fixed in the provider settings (such as `extra_body` or
  `samplingParams`) still takes precedence over the tier, as it does over
  `/effort`. Omitting `effort` inherits the session's effort only while the
  agent stays on the session's provider: a `model` override that switches
  provider starts from that model's own reasoning settings, so pass `effort`
  there. Aliases such as `'med'` and `'x-high'` are accepted; any other value
  rejects the call. Use `'low'` for cheap mechanical stages and the higher tiers
  only for the hardest verify or judge stages. A different effort is a
  different resume cache key.
- `isolation` — `'worktree'` provisions a fresh git worktree under
  `<projectRoot>/.qwen/worktrees/agent-<7hex>`; the worktree is auto-removed if
  no changes, otherwise the path and branch are returned alongside the result.
  `'remote'` makes the admitted agent() resolve to null and records
  "agent({isolation:'remote'}) is not available in this build". A `'worktree'`
  dispatch is also refused — it resolves to null with the reason recorded —
  when the session is already inside a worktree (nested isolation worktrees are
  not supported; to run agents in that worktree, pass it as `workingDir`), when
  git is not available or the directory is not a git repository, when the
  parent working tree has uncommitted changes (the subagent would see a stale
  HEAD), or when the worktree cannot be created. The nested case refuses every
  dispatch, so rule it out before a large `isolation: 'worktree'` fan-out.
- `workingDir` (string) — pin the subagent to an EXISTING git worktree of this
  repository that the caller owns; nothing is created and nothing is removed.
  Use it when the directory the agent must work in already exists and its
  uncommitted state is the point (a review worktree, a checkout a previous step
  provisioned) — exactly the case isolation cannot serve. Mutually exclusive
  with `isolation`. The path must be a linked worktree of this repository
  registered via `git worktree add` (it may live anywhere on disk) — the main
  checkout is not eligible.
- `stallMs` (number, ms) — a no-progress stall watchdog, not a wall-clock cap.
  The dispatch is aborted and retried (up to 3 attempts total) after this many
  milliseconds with no observable subagent progress — including before the
  first response arrives; the timer is suspended while a tool is in flight, so
  a legitimately slow tool is not a stall. Default 180000 (override via
  `QWEN_CODE_WORKFLOW_STALL_SECONDS`, whole seconds); `0` disables the
  watchdog. Wall time per attempt is bounded separately.
- `disallowedTools` (string[]) — tools this agent may not call, on top of the
  floor below; it can only narrow the agent's tools, never re-enable one. Name a
  tool by its tool name (`run_shell_command`, `write_file`, `edit`) or its
  display name (`Shell`, `WriteFile`, `Edit`), or deny MCP tools with
  `mcp__<server>` (every tool of that server), `mcp__<server>__*`, or
  `mcp__<server>__<tool>`. An entry that names no built-in or registered tool
  and is not an `mcp__` pattern, such as `'Bash'`, resolves the call to null
  with the reason recorded rather than silently denying nothing. Entries must
  be non-empty strings without surrounding whitespace, or the call is rejected.
  A `schema` agent whose denies, from this call or from its `agentType`,
  include `structured_output` resolves to null with the reason recorded,
  because it would have no way to return its result. The resume cache key
  depends on which tools are denied, not on their order or duplicates, and not
  on whether a built-in tool is named by its tool name or its display name.
- `tools` (string[]) — the only tools this agent may be given; it narrows and
  never brings back a tool the floor below or a deny takes away. Name tools
  exactly: a built-in by tool or display name, an MCP tool by the name the model
  sees (`mcp__<server>__<tool>`). Patterns (`'*'`, `mcp__<server>`,
  `mcp__<server>__*`), `exec` and an empty list reject the call; in code mode
  the agent keeps `exec`, which can call only the listed tools. An entry that
  names no tool, such as `'Bash'`, resolves the call to null with the reason
  recorded, and so does a list that shares no tool with the `agentType`'s own
  allowlist or whose every tool is denied. A `schema` agent is also given
  `structured_output`. A correctly named tool this session does not have, or one
  no subagent may use (such as `todo_write`), is simply not given, as with an
  `agentType` allowlist. Built-in spellings, order and duplicates do not change
  the resume key; other spellings do.

Workflow subagents can never use AskUserQuestion, SendMessage, Monitor,
EnterPlanMode, ExitPlanMode, or the Agent tool, whatever their `agentType` or
their `tools`. A subagent therefore cannot fan out further and cannot ask anyone
anything: the script owns all fan-out, and every ambiguity has to be resolved in
the prompt it is given. Never ask a subagent to spawn its own verifiers —
dispatch them from the script.

## What agent() returns

A subagent's final text, or the validated object under `schema`.

`agent()` resolves to `null` when that admitted agent fails on its own —
including turn/time caps, model or setup errors, missing structured output, and
exhausted stall retries — and it does so for a bare `await agent()` exactly as
it does inside `parallel()`/`pipeline()`, so check for `null` wherever you read
a result. Call-shape validation failures — such as an empty prompt, an
unsupported option combination, or an invalid option value — reject a bare
call; inside `parallel()`/`pipeline()`, the surrounding ordinary thunk or stage
rejection becomes a position-aligned `null`. Run-level rejections no later call
could survive — the token budget, the 1000-agent cap, and cancellation — throw
and end a `parallel()`/`pipeline()` batch. An admitted agent that fails and
settles to `null` still counts as dispatched and is named, with its error, in
the run's failures list; a `null` returned by an ordinary thunk or stage is not
an agent dispatch.

A `pipeline()` stage that returns `null` — or throws — drops that item: its
remaining stages are skipped and its slot in the result is `null`. So a `null`
check belongs in the stage that dispatched the agent, never in a later stage,
which will not run for that item.

A result must be JSON-serializable to survive the sandbox boundary and the
resume journal. A thunk that resolves to something that is not becomes `null`
at its index.

## Limits

- Concurrency: `max(2, min(16, availableParallelism()-2))` agents in flight per
  run — `availableParallelism()` follows CPU affinity and container CPU limits,
  not the host's core count — override via `QWEN_CODE_MAX_WORKFLOW_CONCURRENCY`
  (clamped to 64).
- 1000 `agent()` calls per run, override via `QWEN_CODE_MAX_WORKFLOW_AGENTS`
  (clamped to 10000). The call past the cap throws.
- 4096 entries in each list of one `parallel()` or `pipeline()` call, with no
  override.
- 30-minute wall-clock cap per run, override via
  `QWEN_CODE_MAX_WORKFLOW_SECONDS` (applied as given). A fan-out near the agent
  cap will not fit inside the default cap.
- 30 seconds for the script's synchronous code before its first `await`, with
  no override. A synchronous loop that runs longer is aborted.
- Per subagent attempt: 50 turns (`QWEN_CODE_WORKFLOW_AGENT_MAX_TURNS`, clamped
  to 500) and 10 minutes (`QWEN_CODE_WORKFLOW_AGENT_MAX_MINUTES`, clamped
  to 100). Raise them for legitimately long work rather than letting agents
  come back `null` — but a value above the clamp is silently cut down to it.
- Stall retries: 3 attempts per `agent()` call; the stall timeout itself
  (`QWEN_CODE_WORKFLOW_STALL_SECONDS`) is applied as given.
- Tokens: a token target or cap may be in effect — read `budget.total`
  (`null` = uncapped) before committing to a large fan-out, because once it is
  reached every further `agent()` call is refused.
- Size guideline: the tool description states the session's guideline — small
  (5 agents), medium (15, the default) or large (50) — or none when the user
  set it to unrestricted. It is advisory: follow it unless the user's prompt
  calls for a different scale. A running workflow that schedules more agents
  than the guideline (25 when unrestricted) or projects past ~1.5M output
  tokens is flagged to the user as a large workflow; it is not stopped.
- The user can steer size from the prompt ("use a small workflow, 5 agents
  max") or with the Dynamic Workflow Size setting. A change made mid-session
  arrives as a reminder that replaces the guideline in the description.

## Default to `pipeline()`

`pipeline()` runs each item through every stage independently — item A can be
in stage 3 while item B is still in stage 1 — so wall-clock is the slowest
single chain. `parallel()` is a barrier: it waits for every thunk before
anything moves on, so it costs the slowest item of every stage.

A barrier is right only when a stage genuinely needs cross-item context:
deduplicating or merging across the full result set before expensive downstream
work, exiting early when the total count is zero, or a prompt that compares one
finding against all the others. It is not justified by needing to flatten, map,
or filter between stages (do that inside a pipeline stage), by two stages being
conceptually separate, or by the code reading more tidily. Smell test:
`parallel()` → a pure transform → `parallel()` is a pipeline someone wrote with
an unnecessary barrier. When in doubt, `pipeline()`.

## Verify before believing

A subagent's answer is a claim, not a result. For findings that matter, spawn
independent verifiers prompted to _refute_, and drop what a majority refutes.
When a claim can be wrong in several different ways, give each verifier a
distinct lens (correctness, security, performance, does it actually reproduce)
— diversity catches what repetition cannot. For a wide solution space, generate
several independent attempts, judge them in parallel, and synthesize from the
winner while grafting the best ideas from the rest.

## Converge deliberately

For discovery of unknown size, keep running finders until some number of
consecutive rounds turn up nothing new; a fixed round count stops partway into
the tail. Deduplicate each round against everything already seen, never against
only what survived judging — otherwise rejected findings reappear every round
and the loop never terminates. A closing pass that asks what is still missing
(a search angle never run, a claim never verified, a file never read) usually
produces the next round of real work.

## Report honestly

Scale the fleet to what was actually asked: a quick check gets a few agents and
one verification pass; an explicit request to be thorough or exhaustive earns a
larger pool and a multi-vote adversarial round. Whenever a run bounds its own
coverage — top-N, sampling, no retry — `log()` what was dropped. Silent
truncation reads as full coverage, which is worse than a smaller honest result.

## Saved workflows and workflow()

`workflow(nameOrRef, args?, { stepId }?)` shares this run's caps. Calls have
individual traces grouping their agents. It nests one level only;
a nested `workflow()` call throws.

It takes one of two forms. `workflow('<name>')` resolves a name against
`<projectRoot>/.qwen/workflows` (project scope, also surfaced as `/<name>`
slash commands) and `~/.qwen/workflows` (user scope, lower precedence when both
define the same name); an active extension's workflow is always named
`'<extension>:<name>'`. `workflow({ scriptPath: '<absolute path>' })` loads a
script file directly from either of those directories, an active extension's
workflow file, or the generated-scripts root
(`$QWEN_CODE_PROJECT_DIR/workflows/generated` — the per-project runtime dir,
not the project tree); any other path is refused. A bare string is always a name: a path passed as a string is rejected
as an invalid workflow name. At the top level that rejection ends the run;
inside `parallel()`/`pipeline()` it becomes a position-aligned `null` like any
other thunk rejection — with no agent dispatched and nothing in the failures
list — so null-check a `workflow()` result too. In a session that runs named
workflows only (`tools.workflowNameOnly`), `workflow({ scriptPath })` throws the
same way; nest by name.

Use the `workflow-creator` skill to create or edit saved workflows.

## Resume and diagnostics

Every run hands back its runId, the script's path on disk, and its journal
path. An inline script is persisted under the generated-scripts root, so a
resume edits that file and passes the path back instead of re-sending the whole
source.

`resumeFromRunId` replays a prior run: each `agent()` call's journal key hashes
its prompt and opts chained in call order, so calls whose rolling prefix-hash
still matches are served from cache for the longest unchanged prefix, and the
first changed or missing call onward runs live. Post-processing after the last
agent can therefore change freely without losing the cache. Pass the same
`args` — they seed the chain, so different args re-run everything. A run whose
journal is no longer on disk has nothing to resume: the call is refused before
any agent runs, so start it again without `resumeFromRunId`. A run id that is
still running, paused, or not yet exited is refused too, since a second start
would run two copies of its agents against one journal. A run whose process
exited mid-run is later listed as failed with an `interrupted` error, and
resumes like any other.

The journal is one JSON line per event: a `launched` line when the run starts
(never on a resume), a `started` line when an agent is dispatched, then a `result` line when it returns a value or a `failed` line
when it settles without one. Only `result` lines feed the resume cache. A
`started` line with neither after it means the run was interrupted with that
agent in flight — not that the agent is broken. Read the journal before
diagnosing an empty or surprising result: a cached result can itself be empty,
and a `null` slot in the output means an agent failed, not that the work found
nothing.

Runs appear in the background-tasks view and the `/workflows` dialog (live
phase tree, token usage, cooperative pause/resume, cancel);
`run_in_background: true` returns a run handle immediately in the interactive
TUI and delivers completion through the conversation.

Saved `/<name>` commands typed in the interactive TUI's ink renderer stay in the foreground:
watch the live tool card; `/workflows <runId>` shows the run after it settles.
Completion displays the result and delivers it to the model through a
notification, without another user prompt.
The OpenTUI renderer does not yet run client-scheduled tools; there, ask the
model to call `Workflow({ name: '<name>' })` instead.

## Worked example

Review a change set across several dimensions, verifying each finding as soon
as its dimension is done — a pipeline, so a slow dimension never holds up
verification of a fast one.

```js
export const meta = {
  name: 'Review changes',
  description: 'Review the diff across dimensions and verify every finding',
  phases: [
    { title: 'Review', detail: 'One reviewer per dimension reads the diff' },
    {
      title: 'Verify',
      detail: 'An independent verifier tries to refute each finding',
    },
  ],
};

const DIMENSIONS = [
  {
    key: 'correctness',
    lens: 'logic errors, wrong edge cases, broken invariants',
  },
  {
    key: 'security',
    lens: 'injection, path traversal, secrets, unsafe defaults',
  },
  {
    key: 'performance',
    lens: 'accidental O(n^2), unbounded memory, chatty I/O',
  },
];

const FINDINGS = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    findings: {
      type: 'array',
      items: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: {
          file: { type: 'string' },
          claim: { type: 'string' },
        },
        required: ['file', 'claim'],
      },
    },
  },
  required: ['findings'],
};

const VERDICT = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: { isReal: { type: 'boolean' }, why: { type: 'string' } },
  required: ['isReal', 'why'],
};

const target = args?.target;
if (!target) {
  throw new Error('args.target is required, e.g. { target: "HEAD~1..HEAD" }');
}

phase('Review');
const reviewed = await pipeline(
  DIMENSIONS,
  // The stage that dispatches an agent is the stage that handles its null:
  // returning null here would drop the dimension and skip the verify stage.
  async (dimension) => {
    const review = await agent(
      `Review the changes in ${target} for ${dimension.lens}. ` +
        `Read the files; do not edit anything.`,
      { label: `review:${dimension.key}`, schema: FINDINGS },
    );
    if (review === null) {
      log(`review:${dimension.key} came back empty — its findings are missing`);
      return [];
    }
    return review.findings;
  },
  (findings, dimension) => {
    phase('Verify');
    return parallel(
      findings.map((finding, index) => async () => {
        const label = `verify:${dimension.key}:${index + 1}`;
        const verdict = await agent(
          `Adversarially verify this claim about ${finding.file}: ` +
            `"${finding.claim}". Try to REFUTE it. Read the code first.`,
          { label, schema: VERDICT },
        );
        if (verdict === null) {
          log(`${label} came back empty — "${finding.claim}" is unverified`);
          return null;
        }
        return { ...finding, verdict };
      }),
    );
  },
);

// A stage that throws drops its dimension to a null slot. Say which ones
// before flattening, or the drop reads as a dimension that found nothing.
reviewed.forEach((entries, index) => {
  if (entries === null) {
    log(
      `${DIMENSIONS[index].key} was dropped before its findings were verified`,
    );
  }
});
const verdicts = reviewed.filter((entries) => entries !== null).flat();
const confirmed = verdicts.filter(
  (entry) => entry !== null && entry.verdict.isReal,
);
const refuted = verdicts.filter(
  (entry) => entry !== null && !entry.verdict.isReal,
);
log(`confirmed ${confirmed.length} finding(s), refuted ${refuted.length}`);
return { confirmed, refuted };
```

Note what the example does with failure: it refuses to run without the input
it needs, handles each `null` in the stage that dispatched the agent, gives
every verify dispatch its own label, `log()`s every dimension and agent it
loses, and returns what the verifiers refuted next to what they confirmed — a
verifier can be wrong too, and nothing is silently omitted.

## Scaling to the token budget

When the user's message sets a turn target with a `+500k`-style directive
(`+1m`, "use 300k tokens"), `budget.total` is that target and `spent()` then
counts every output token this turn — the main loop and every agent, not just
this run. Otherwise `total` is an operator's per-run cap, or `null`. Once
`spent()` reaches `total`, further `agent()` calls throw; agents already
running are not stopped by it. Loop with
`while (budget.total && budget.remaining() > 50_000) { ... }` — guard on
`budget.total`, since with no target `remaining()` is `Infinity` and the loop
runs to the 1000-agent cap — or size a fan-out once with
`const FLEET = budget.total ? Math.floor(budget.total / 100_000) : 5;`.
