/**
 * The read cache is one map shared by every bundled reference in the process,
 * so the skill name is the only thing keeping two references apart. Both are
 * reachable in a single session — `config.ts` registers `AgentTool`
 * unconditionally and `WorkflowTool` on the same `Config` — and whichever tool
 * is constructed first populates the entry the other then reads. A cache
 * narrowed back to the single slot this map was extracted from therefore
 * inlines one tool's reference into the other's description, silently.
 *
 * These cases read both references through one module instance, on purpose and
 * in both orders. Each order gets a cold cache of its own — one
 * `vi.resetModules()` per case, then one re-import, so the two reads of a case
 * share a single fresh instance. The reset has to stay per case rather than per
 * read: a fresh registry for every read would hand each one an empty cache and
 * let a single-slot cache pass, which is the failure being pinned.
 * (`workflow-authoring-skill.test.ts` does reset, for the opposite reason — it
 * needs the cache cold to exercise a failed read.)
