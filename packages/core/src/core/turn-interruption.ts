/**
 * Classification of how a session's last turn ended, computed from persisted
 * chat history alone (no in-memory request refs), so it works across process
 * restarts — unlike the Ctrl+Y retry path, which depends on
 * `lastPromptRef` surviving in the same process.
 *
 * The history tail determines the classification:
 *  - `interrupted_prompt`: the tail is one or more non-structural `user`
 *    entries — a prompt (or a tool_result submission) whose model response
 *    never landed. Continuing means re-submitting their `parts` with Retry
 *    semantics: the send path strips the orphaned trailing user entries and
 *    re-pushes the same content under the same logical turn, so the transcript
 *    gains no new user message.
 *  - `interrupted_turn`: the tail is a `model` entry carrying `functionCall`s
 *    that no `functionResponse` ever answered (crash/abort mid tool run).
 *    Continuing means closing each pair with a synthesized error
 *    `functionResponse` submitted as a ToolResult — a legal continuation
 *    signal that needs no synthetic user text.
 *  - `none`: the turn ended cleanly (model text tail), the tail is a
 *    structural pure system-reminder entry (strip refuses to pop those, so a
 *    Retry would duplicate content), the tail is only system-injected
 *    background notifications (recorded before their automatic turn ran, so
 *    nothing owes them a response), or history is empty.
 *
 * A model text tail that was truncated mid-stream is indistinguishable from
 * a clean finish without persisted stop_reason metadata, so it classifies as
 * `none` here; recovering that case needs provider prefill support and is
 * tracked separately.

/**
 * Whether `content` is a system-injected background notification rather than
 * user input: the entry is user-role and EVERY part is a `<task-notification>`
 * envelope.
 *
 * The role check is the provenance signal, and it has to come first: the
 * envelope shape is not defanged against model output (see the trust-model
 * note above), so a MODEL entry whose whole text is a bare envelope — the user
 * asked the model to echo a notification verbatim, or injected tool/web
 * content steered the reply into ending with one — would otherwise be trimmed
 * away. That exposes the prompt the model *did* answer as the tail and returns
 * `interrupted_prompt` for a session that ended cleanly, re-introducing the
 * exact false banner this trim exists to remove. Requiring user-role cannot
 * drop a real notification: `createNotificationRecord`
 * (`packages/core/src/services/chatRecordingService.ts`) builds every one from
 * `createBaseRecord('user')`.
 *
 * The "every part" requirement is what keeps a real prompt out, and it is
 * deliberately NOT relaxed for `<system-reminder>` parts: per-turn reminders
 * ride alongside the prompt text in the SAME `user` entry, and a mid-turn
 * drain can merge background parts into a genuine user message — both have a
 * non-structural part, so neither matches. A DELIVERED notification turn
 * (`[...systemReminders, ...notificationParts]` as one entry) is therefore
 * left in place on purpose. Only the cold projection this trim exists for is
 * single-part (`recordNotification([{ text: item.modelText }], …)` →
 * `createNotificationRecord` → `createUserContent`; a co-recorded
 * `droppedSummary` is a separate record, so adjacent cold entries each trim
 * individually). Allowing reminders would also trim a notification turn that
 * was admitted, ran and then failed mid-stream — no `functionCall` delivered,
 * so no model entry was pushed and that user entry is the tail with nothing in
 * flight — certifying `clean` for the textbook `interrupted_prompt` documented
 * above and leaving it with no re-drive at all. The in-flight window the
 * reminder allowance was meant to cover is refused independently by the
 * `#hasActiveTurn()` guard in `Session.getRecoveryStatus()`.
 *
 * Shape alone cannot separate that from a real user prompt whose entire text
 * IS a bare envelope (the user pasted one, or asked for a verbatim echo): the
 * entry is user-role, single-part and wrapped, so every clause above matches.
 * Trimming it exposes the PREVIOUS model turn as the tail and returns `none`,
 * certifying `clean` for a prompt that was never answered — and the next send
 * pops it out of live history through `stripOrphanedUserEntriesFromHistory`.
 * Callers that have the source records therefore pass
 * `trailingSystemNotifications` to {@link effectiveHistoryEnd}, which narrows
 * the trim to entries the recorder actually stamped as notifications. This
 * predicate stays shape-based because it is also the fallback for callers that
 * hold only raw `Content[]`.
 *
 * The same shape collision exists between a cold record and a FAILED live
 * notification turn whose entry carries no reminders (no plan mode, no output
 * style, no active todo chain): both are single-envelope user entries, and
 * both records carry `provenance: 'system'` + `subtype: 'notification'`.
 * `backgroundTurn` cannot separate them — the `channelTask` admission branch
 * runs the turn with `backgroundTurnContext.exit(...)` — so the recorder
 * stamps the turn's own entry `deliveredTurn: true` when the `client.ts` send
 * path admits it (chatRecordingService.ts), and the projection's count
 * excludes stamped entries. Wherever that count is forwarded — today only the
 * record-derived `buildSessionRecoveryPlan` callers (the TUI's resume and
 * session-switch paths) — a failed stamped turn is left in place and
 * classifies as the textbook `interrupted_prompt` documented above. Callers
 * that hold only raw `Content[]` (headless
 * `continueInterrupted`/`continue_last_turn`, and the daemon) forward no
 * count, keep the shape-only trim, and still trim a stamped envelope: with no
 * count `authoritativeFrom` is `-Infinity`, so the trim's only bail-out is
 * unreachable and every trailing envelope-shaped entry goes. When the count IS
 * supplied, only unstamped records — cold copies persisted before any turn
 * ran — are trimmed.
 *
 * The stamp is written on the `LlmClient.sendMessageStream` send path — the
 * TUI and headless runtimes. The ACP/serve daemon sends its notification
 * turns through `Session.#sendMessageStreamWithAutoCompression` →
 * `LlmChat.sendMessageStream`, which records nothing; its entry is written
 * either pre-admission by `recordNotificationStrict` (no stamp parameter) or
 * post-admission at send time by `recordNotification` (the unpersisted
 * registry-callback branch) — the latter overload takes the stamp, but both
 * sites write before the send commits, so an abort or a null `responseStream`
 * afterwards would stamp a turn that never ran. A reminder-less entry the
 * daemon delivered is therefore still unmarked, still counted, still trimmed
 * and still reported `clean`. That daemon residual of #12042 shape A stays
 * open
 * (`docs/design/session-crash-recovery/session-crash-recovery-interruption-detection.md`,
 * "Not covered yet"); closing it needs a marker written after the send
 * commits or a daemon-side re-drive, not a stamp at either existing site.
 * Stamping the cold record itself is not an option: it is written before
 * `assertCanStartTurn()`, so turns later refused or deferred would carry the
 * stamp too. The `LlmClient` stamp sits after admission but still above that
 * path's own pre-send refusal gates, so it carries the same imprecision on a
 * narrower set of exits; that residual is accepted and quantified on
 * `ChatRecord.deliveredTurn` rather than restated here.
 *
 * Needed at all because the record's `subtype: 'notification'` and
 * `provenance: 'system'` cannot ride along on `Content` (that type comes from
 * `@google/genai`), so the live history tail carries no metadata to read and
 * the projection has to report it separately (`session-api-history.ts`).
