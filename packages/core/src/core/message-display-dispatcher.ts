 * (`DEFAULT_COMMAND_HOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` in hooks/hook-timeout.ts)
 * because a slow or hung MessageDisplay hook shouldn't be able to freeze
 * `qwen -p` or an ACP stream loop's `finally` for anywhere near that long.
 * The budget is shared across finish() calls (client.ts calls it from an
 * explicit exit site and again from a finally), so this constant is the
 * ceiling itself, not a per-call increment. The hook has already received
 * the `is_final` payload by the time this wait starts — the timeout only
 * bounds how long the caller waits for the hook to finish executing, and

/**
 * Owns the delivery side of the MessageDisplay hook for ONE streamed message:
 * mints the `message_id`, folds streamed chunks through the pure
 * {@link stepMessageDisplay} debounce, and dispatches due flushes through
 * MessageBus without ever blocking the streaming loop that feeds it.
 *
 * Mid-stream delivery is coalescing, not queueing: at most one hook request
 * is in flight at a time, and at most one payload is held pending behind it.
 * A newer flush simply overwrites the pending payload — lossless, because
 * `displayed_text` is cumulative, so the newest payload strictly supersedes
 * any older one. This bounds a slow hook's backlog to O(1) instead of letting
 * undelivered batches accumulate for the length of the stream.
 *
 * The final payload is the one exception to the single-request rule:
 * {@link finish} dispatches it immediately, alongside any still-running
 * mid-stream delivery, rather than queueing behind it. The same supersession
 * argument applies one slot further — an in-flight mid-stream payload carries
 * strictly less information than the final one, so waiting for it to settle
 * would only delay `is_final` by a full hook execution, and in a short-lived
 * process (headless `-p`) could drop it entirely when the process exits with
 * the final payload still queued. A hook may therefore see its last
 * mid-stream execution overlap the final one.
 *
 * {@link finish} is idempotent and resolves once the final payload's
 * delivery has completed, or after {@link MESSAGE_DISPLAY_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_MS}
 * — whichever comes first — so callers can await it before ending the turn
 * without a hung hook holding the turn hostage.
