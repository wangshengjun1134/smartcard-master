 * - re-validated and re-pinned at every redirect hop (a permitted same-host

 * - Node only: refused outright on runtimes that accept the pinning agent and

 * - refused outright behind a configured proxy, for the same reason as the
 *   Bun case: through a proxy CONNECT tunnel the proxy resolves the name
 *   itself and the pinned `connect.lookup` never runs, so the pin would be a
 *   claim we cannot keep — while the bare pinned Agent, dispatching directly,
 *   would silently bypass the proxy users are required to route through;
 * - redirects followed only when same-host/protocol/port (isPermittedRedirect),
 *   bounded by MAX_REDIRECTS;
 * - `maxBytes` enforced against BOTH Content-Length and actual bytes written;
 * - three-timer model: resolve watchdog (30s, covering the DNS
 *   resolve-and-pin step), header timeout (30s, cleared when headers arrive),
 *   plus an idle watchdog reset per chunk (60s) — a slow large body is fine,
