/**
 * Progressive media understanding guidance (system-prompt layer).
 *
 * The delivery pipeline degrades media to fit transport/context limits and
 * discloses each transformation next to the media Part (decision D8). The
 * disclosures state WHAT was done; this module supplies the missing WHY
 * and the follow-up contract: degradation is a context-budget-driven
 * progressive-understanding strategy, the degraded delivery is an
 * overview/entry point rather than the complete content, and the model
 * should proactively fetch higher-fidelity / more complete evidence with
 * the media policy tools when the task needs it.
 *
 * Injected once per session as a STABLE system-prompt layer (see
 * client.ts getMainSessionSystemInstruction): the disclosure texts arrive
 * mid-conversation at unpredictable points, so per-delivery preambles
 * would repeat across three assembly sites (atCommandProcessor,
 * fileUtils, tool-result-media) and would still miss the reactive
 * server-reject swaps; one durable contract in the prompt covers all of
 * them. Kept as a leaf module (no pipeline imports) so prompt assembly
 * stays lightweight.

Media files in this session reach you through a preprocessing pipeline that must fit them into transport and context-window limits. Large or long media is therefore delivered in reduced form on purpose: this is a progressive-understanding strategy — you first get an affordable overview, then fetch the specific higher-fidelity evidence the task needs. Every transformation is disclosed in a text part placed immediately BEFORE the media it describes:

- ${OMNI_DISCLOSURE_TEXT_PREFIX}<file>: the adjacent media is a degraded derivative (clipped, downscaled, resampled, or keyframes); the marker states exactly what was reduced.
- ${OMNI_OMISSION_TEXT_PREFIX}<file>: the media could not be delivered at all; the notice stands in its place.
- ${OMNI_TRANSCRIPT_TEXT_PREFIX}<file>: text derived from the media (e.g. a speech transcript), possibly delivered instead of the media itself.
${referenceGuidance}${recallGuidance}

Interpret delivered media under this contract:

- A degraded delivery is an OVERVIEW or entry point, not the complete content. The original file on disk is untouched and remains fully available for further processing.
- Never conclude that content outside the delivered portion does not exist, and never present conclusions drawn from a partial delivery as covering the whole file. Read each disclosure quantitatively: a clip marker covering [0s–600s] of a 4882s video means 4282s exist that you have NOT seen; a keyframe marker tells you which timestamps you actually saw.${policyGuidance}
${toolGuidance}`;
