/**
 * Slug patterns for throwaway worktrees we are willing to auto-clean.
 *
 * Currently only the `agent-<7hex>` shape produced by
 * `AgentTool isolation:'worktree'` qualifies. User-named worktrees created
 * via `EnterWorktreeTool` are managed manually via `ExitWorktreeTool`, and
 * `validateUserWorktreeSlug` reserves the `agent-` prefix — except for the
 * exact `agent-<7hex>` shape, which is allowed through so `AgentTool`
 * isolation can share the same `createUserWorktree` path. A user can
 * therefore still pick that exact shape explicitly, and on disk such a
 * worktree is indistinguishable from an ephemeral agent one (no marker
 * records which path created it). That is why the dirty check below must
 * treat ANY content — including untracked files — as a reason to keep the
 * worktree, minus the three exemptions {@link worktreeHasWork} enumerates
 * (disposable build output, symlinks, the session marker): name-shape
 * matching alone cannot protect a user-named `agent-<7hex>` worktree from
 * being swept (issue #12735).
 *
 * Mirrors claude-code's `EPHEMERAL_WORKTREE_PATTERNS` in
 * `utils/worktree.ts`, restricted to the patterns qwen-code actually emits.
