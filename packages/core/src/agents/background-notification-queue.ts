/**
 * @fileoverview Admission rule shared by the two front ends that cap queued
 * background notifications: the interactive TUI and the ACP `Session`.
 * The headless CLI's local queue is not capped here.
 *
 * Both front ends turn a queued notification into a model turn once the
 * session goes idle. Without a cap, a noisy producer — a monitor printing on
 * every poll, ten background agents finishing at once — grows the queue
 * without bound, and a single drain then feeds the whole backlog into one
 * turn. The rule here bounds the queue and picks what to evict, so the
 * notifications that carry irreplaceable results survive and the repetitive
 * ones are the first to go.
 *
 * Overflow discards are not silent: the caller records each one in a
 * {@link DroppedNotificationTally} and folds one summary line into the next
 * compatible drained turn. A caller may omit already-cancelled monitor pulses
 * that its normal drain would prune without delivery.
 */
