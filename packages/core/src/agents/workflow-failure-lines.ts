/**
 * @fileoverview Which agents failed, and how, as one list shared by every
 * surface that reports a run.
 *
 * A run that dispatched twelve agents and lost three of them used to report
 * `agents_failed=3` and stop there. The count says a fan-out is thinner than
 * it looks; it does not say which slots are missing or why, which is exactly
 * what the reader has to know to decide between re-running, narrowing the
 * prompt, and carrying on with what came back. The error text was already in
 * the registry — it just never left it.
 *
 * Bounded on purpose: a run that lost forty agents to one outage would
 * otherwise bury its own result under forty near-identical lines.
