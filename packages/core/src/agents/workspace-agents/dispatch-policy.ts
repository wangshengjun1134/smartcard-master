/**
 * @fileoverview Whether a new thread post books work for a given agent.
 *
 * Kept pure and separate from the daemon service that acts on it, because
 * these rules are the difference between a working agent and a token fire:
 * every one exists to stop a specific runaway or duplicate.
 *
 * The scope is deliberately narrow — **book, coalesce, or refuse**. Whether a
 * booked run can start *right now* is the dispatcher's business, because it
 * depends on what the agent's single body happens to be doing. An earlier
 * revision had this function return `defer` for a busy agent, which put a
 * scheduling decision inside a rules function and gave the same situation two
 * spellings. A run that cannot start yet is simply a queued run.
 *
 * The rules: coalesce rather than double-book, never let an author wake
 * itself, let an explicit mention take routing away from the assignee, and
 * fail closed. The budget rules exist because two workspace agents answering
 * each other have nothing else to stop them.
