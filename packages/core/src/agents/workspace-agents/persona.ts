 * Fails closed in both directions that matter. An id with no roster entry means
 * the agent was deleted while its session was starting; a definition that will
 * not load means the workspace is misconfigured. Neither may fall back to a
 * generic persona — an agent that quietly becomes "some assistant" would still
 * post under its name, and every guard in the capability boundary is derived
 * from the definition it would have skipped.
 *
 * Puts this identity contract and its own instructions after an optional
 * definition prompt.
 *
 * A linked definition is a reusable behaviour template, not the execution
 * identity. Keeping the identity contract last prevents a definition written
 * for the subagent runtime from turning a persistent workspace Agent back into
 * a child of some parent session.
