/**
 * @fileoverview The ambient binding a agent turn executes under.
 *
 * An agent may run several task sessions concurrently, so "which thread is
 * this?" cannot come from the model or a process-global register that async
 * work would leak across. It comes from an
 * `AsyncLocalStorage` frame established at the per-turn seam — the same place
 * `runWithAgentContext` is established inside `runBackgroundTurn`, which the
 * resident continuation re-enters for every turn.
 *
 * Wrapping a session lifetime once would let later turns inherit stale run
 * authority; this module binds every turn instead.
