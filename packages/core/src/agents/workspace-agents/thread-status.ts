/**
 * @fileoverview Thread status as an aggregate over every run, not last-writer-wins.
 *
 * Several agents work one thread. If each could stamp the thread's status when
 * its own run ended, the last one to finish would decide: an agent reviewing
 * its part would hide another agent still working, and a blocker raised by one
 * would be erased by another's clean exit. So no run writes the status. Each
 * run instead leaves a durable *close obligation*, and the status is derived
 * from the obligations that are still outstanding.
 *
 * Three rules here exist because a review of an earlier revision found each one
 * missing, and each failure was a thread stuck in a state nobody could clear:
 *
 * - A same-thread wait is discharged by any later close or human post. Without
 *   it, `A waits for B; B reviews without @-ing A` left A's wait looking
 *   orphaned, and blocked-class outranks review, so the thread reported
 *   `blocked` when it was ready for a person.
 * - Any later successful booking discharges an earlier failure or unclosed
 *   return, not only human feedback. Without it one launch failure pinned the
 *   thread to `blocked` forever, even after another agent did the work.
 * - An admission that books nothing and leaves no runnable target yields
 *   `blocked`. Without it a post whose assignee was disabled, or that named
 *   nobody at all, left the thread sitting in `in_progress` with no live run
 *   and no explanation — the silent path this design refuses to have.
