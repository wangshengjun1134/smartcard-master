/**
 * @fileoverview Leases for outbound Host execution (plan P4).
 *
 * A managed Host reaches out; nothing reaches in. That means the daemon cannot
 * tell a Host that is thinking from one whose network died, so work it holds
 * has to become available again on its own. The danger in doing that is the
 * obvious one: the first Host comes back and writes its result over work a
 * second Host has since done.
 *
 * A lease is what makes reclaiming safe. Re-acquiring mints a new `leaseId`,
 * and every write is checked against both the id and the run attempt, so a
 * worker holding a stale lease is refused rather than believed. That check is
 * pure state, so it is settled here rather than waiting for two machines.
 *
 * This module owns the atomic pickup and result commit. HTTP only authenticates
 * the Host and carries these decisions across the network.
