/**
 * @fileoverview The line between an agent that failed and a run that failed.
 *
 * A workflow dispatches agents the way a script calls functions, but an agent
 * is not a function: it can hit its turn cap, time out, have its model error
 * out, stall, or fail during setup, and none of that says anything about
 * whether the REST of the script can proceed. Those outcomes are the agent's
 * own, and the script sees them as `null` — the same value `parallel()` and
 * `pipeline()` have always put in a slot whose agent did not come back.
 *
 * The token budget, the agent cap, and cancellation belong to the run. Those
 * throw, because no later `agent()` call can succeed either.
 *
 * Before this split, a bare `await agent()` threw on all of it while the same
 * failure inside `parallel()` became `null`, so the same broken agent ended a
 * sequential script and merely dented a fan-out. `WorkflowAgentFailedError`
 * is the marker that lets the dispatch layer settle the first group to `null`
 * in both shapes, and it is what the journal records as `failed`.
