/**
 * @fileoverview What `agent({ tools })` accepts, and how a dispatch narrows a
 * subagent to it.
 *
 * An allowlist only ever narrows. The dispatch writes the result onto the
 * subagent's `tools`, the same field an agent definition's own allowlist uses,
 * and the subagent's declaration filter does the rest: a tool outside that list
 * is never declared, and a call for an undeclared tool is answered "not found"
 * rather than run. Denies are applied after the allowlist, so an allowlist can
 * never bring back a tool the workflow floor or a deny takes away.
 *
 * Entries are exact tool names. The declaration filter looks each allowlist
 * entry up by exact name and expands no pattern, so a pattern would name
 * nothing the agent could ever be given; it is refused rather than accepted and
 * silently dropped. `exec` is refused too: in code mode it is the surface the
 * agent calls other tools through, and naming it would hand over every tool it
 * can call.
 *
 * The checks here are about names only. Whether a named tool is actually
 * available to the subagent (registered in this session, not hidden, not a
 * control-plane tool) is decided by the declaration filter, exactly as it is
 * for an agent definition's allowlist.
