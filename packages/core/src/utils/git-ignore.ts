// The one shared `git check-ignore` probe. Consolidated from two
// module-private copies (review's test-plan.ts, team memory's
// team-memory-git-status.ts) so every guard that asks "can this path be
// committed?" gets git's own answer, under a deadline, with no memo — a
// caller that re-asks the same key (a remedy re-check, a write-time
// re-check) must receive a fresh answer, so caching stays caller-side.
//
// Deliberately NOT GitIgnoreParser (gitIgnoreParser.ts): that in-process
// matcher reads the ignore files itself and misses sources a linked
// worktree or a global excludesFile would supply, so its verdict can
// diverge from git's in either direction — a guard needs git's own answer.

/**
 * Returns true when `path` is git-ignored under the worktree at `worktree`.
 * Uses `git check-ignore` (exit 0 = ignored, 1 = not). Any other outcome
 * (git missing, not a worktree, fatal error, kill on the deadline) is
 * treated as not-ignored so a guard never passes on a false signal.
 *
 * Probe a representative FILE, not the directory: a directory-form
 * re-include negation only applies to paths git knows are directories, so
 * probing the directory can spuriously report ignored. The path need not
 * exist — check-ignore evaluates the ignore rules against the pathname.
 *
 * `timeoutMs` bounds the spawn. The 5 s default suits a guard probing its
 * own repository; a caller probing a worktree it does not control passes
 * the generous deadline its other git calls run under — a kill reads as
 * "not ignored", which would accuse a correct Test Plan.
