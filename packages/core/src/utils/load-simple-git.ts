/**
 * Wraps the simple-git factory so no client it produces can be turned into a
 * program launch by the repository it is pointed at.
 *
 * Every git call in this repository that goes through simple-git goes through
 * this loader, which makes it the one place the guard has to exist — a call
 * site added later inherits it. Guarding only the read-only commands would be
 * theatre here: `add --all`, `reset` and `stash create` were all measured to
 * run the helper too, and the worktree flows reach a `diff` through exactly
 * those.
 *
 * `allowUnsafeFsMonitor` is unavoidable: simple-git's argv parser refuses the
 * key by name whatever value it carries, so its blocklist would reject our own
 * guard. What that blocklist buys is narrower than it looks — it screens a
 * *caller-supplied* value and does nothing about the repository's own config,
 * and a planted `.git/config` was measured running its helper through an
 * unmodified simple-git client. What turning it off costs is real, though:
 * config from this option is emitted before the subcommand, so a `-c
 * core.fsmonitor=` that a caller put in *command* argv lands after ours and
 * wins (measured). The position that decides it is the subcommand — git only
 * reads `-c` before the subcommand, so no caller value can reach the guard as
 * long as nothing caller-derived precedes the subcommand. A leading *literal*
 * global flag (e.g. `--no-optional-locks` on a `status` probe) is safe for
 * the same reason: it is a fixed token, not a
 * caller-supplied entry, so it can neither carry a `-c` nor push one ahead of
 * the subcommand. A call site must keep it that way: no caller-derived entry
 * before the subcommand, and, as on the extension git client, no user- or
 * extension-derived config.
