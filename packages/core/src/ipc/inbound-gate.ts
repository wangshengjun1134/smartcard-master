/**
 * Decides what happens to an inbound peer message before this session's
 * model ever sees it.
 *
 * Four outcomes: **accept** (queue it), **hold** (park it for the user to
 * review, model never sees it), **refuse** (turn it away because policy
 * says so, and tell the sender), **dropped** (never metered in at all —
 * see the admission note below).
 *
 * The explicit `crossSessionInbound` setting wins when set. When it is
 * unset the policy is derived from **approval-mode parity**, which
 * encodes one idea: a message auto-delivers only between sessions of
 * the same review class. Every approval mode falls in one of two
 * classes — `prompting`, where a person still inspects each action, and
 * `bypass`, where some actions can be applied with no one looking — and
 * the sender asserts its class on the frame.
 *
 *   arriving faster than this session takes  → dropped (before policy)
 *   sender is a process this session started → accept
 *   sender presented a controller grant       → accept
 *   receiver mode unknown/unrecognized        → hold  (fail closed)
 *   sender asserts no class                   → hold
 *   sender class equals receiver class        → accept
 *   sender class differs from receiver class  → hold
 *   policy setting unreadable                 → hold  (fail closed)
 *
 * The first two rows are the cases where the transport knows something
 * about the sender. A connection that authenticated with the child token
 * was opened by a script or hook this session itself ran, and whatever it
 * can ask for, the session already chose to run the thing that is asking.
 * A connection that presented a controller grant belongs to a program the
 * user minted a token for by hand and handed it to, to relay their own
 * instructions; parity compares two sessions' review classes, and that is
 * not a session. Parity has nothing to weigh in either case. The explicit
 * setting still wins over both — a user who said `hold` reviews
 * everything, own processes and controllers included.
 *
 * The rule holds in both directions on purpose. A bypassing receiver has
 * to be careful about a prompting sender because a peer can ask it for a
 * file change that no human or classifier sees: auto-edit approves every
 * edit-shaped tool call outright, and AUTO's in-workspace edit fast path
 * runs before its classifier. A prompting receiver has a per-action
 * backstop, but that backstop guards single actions, not the session's
 * agenda: a message from a session nobody is watching is model-authored
 * input, and a user who chose to review everything did not choose to
 * have their model steered by it one benign-looking step at a time.
 * Per-action prompts are also exactly the surface that fatigue turns
 * into rubber stamps. So the prompting receiver holds it too, and the
 * user releases it from `/peers` if they want it.
 *
 * A frame that asserts no class comes from a script, an older build, or
 * an external process. The receiver has nothing to pair it with, so it
 * is held for every receiver; an external process the user wants driving
 * their session earns delivery through a controller grant — explicit
 * trust the user minted — rather than through the receiver guessing.
 *
 * A hold is not open-ended. The sender is blocked on a decision that
 * only a person can give, so a parked message expires after
 * `agents.crossSessionHeldExpiry` (five minutes by default) and the
 * sender is told, rather than being left unable to distinguish "still
 * waiting" from "never coming". The two negative receipts stay distinct
 * for the same reason: `refused` means this session's policy turns peer
 * messages away and nobody looked, `denied` means somebody did.
 *
 * The sender's half of the parity is self-asserted and unverifiable —
 * nothing authenticates `fromMode`, and any process running as this user
 * can claim anything. It is a cooperation signal that keeps honest
 * sessions from surprising each other, not an access control; the
 * envelope's authority notice and the classifier are what stand up to a
 * hostile peer.
 *
 * Before any of that, a message has to get past the admission meter
 * (`peer-admission.ts`). A `rate-limited` or `duplicate` drop happens
 * there, above policy, so it carries no policy verdict and nobody decided
 * anything about it. A `queue-full` drop is the other half of the same
 * outcome and sits lower: policy already said accept, and the buffer it
 * was accepted into — the session's input queue, or the hold buffer —
 * had no room. Whichever it was, the message is never seen by the model
 * or by the user, and none of them leaves a tombstone, so an honest retry
 * later can still land. The sender is told once per burst rather than
 * once per message — see `peer-drop-reports.ts` for why a report about a
 * flood must not scale with it.
