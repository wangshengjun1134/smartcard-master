/**
 * How a peer session's message is presented to this session's model.
 *
 * Two jobs, and they are separate on purpose:
 *
 * 1. **Attribution.** The content is wrapped in a
 *    `<cross_session_message from="…">` envelope so the model can tell it
 *    apart from something its user typed. Every `<` in the body is
 *    escaped, so only transport-owned envelope and authority delimiters are
 *    tags in the delivered text — a peer cannot close the envelope early and
 *    forge a second one, no matter what it wedges into the token: the match is
 *    structural (no raw bracket survives) rather than an enumeration of
 *    separator spellings an attacker can always extend.
 *
 * 2. **Authority.** A fixed framing states that a peer carries none of
 *    the user's authority. This matters more here than for teammates: a
 *    peer is a *different session*, with its own permission settings and
 *    its own user-approved boundaries, and the failure mode is specific —
 *    a session that has been denied an action asking a second session to
 *    run it, laundering the denial.
