This runtime controls the user's existing Chrome through an explicitly installed extension and a local Native Messaging bridge.

## Control boundary

- Multiple sessions share the profile while controlling separate tabs. Claiming a tab held by another session returns TAB_OWNERSHIP_CONFLICT; wait for its release or choose another tab.
- This runtime is bound to the Chrome profile it first connected to; setup's browserAgent.browsers.get('chrome') picks the default. browserAgent.browsers.list() lists the available profiles. To work in a different one, reset the Node REPL kernel and pass its id to browserAgent.browsers.get(id) during setup instead.

- Installing the extension is the user's consent. browser.user.openTabs() lists every open top-level http(s) tab across the user's Chrome windows, ordered by lastOpened descending.
- To take over an already-open tab, call browser.user.openTabs(), choose the matching returned object by its visible title, url, lastOpened and tabGroup, then pass that exact object to browser.user.claimTab().
- Claiming controls the chosen tab in place, without moving it into an agent tab group, and returns a normal controllable Tab.
- A claim fails closed if the tab title or URL changed after discovery; list open tabs again instead of claiming a different tab.
- Do not guess tab ids. Only claim ids that came from the current openTabs() result.
- tabs.new() creates a new agent tab in the user's Chrome; it shares the profile's cookies and signed-in state.
- browser.user.history({ queries?, from?, to?, limit? }) lists recent browsing history ordered by dateVisited descending. Without from, Chrome searches the last 24 hours; pass from explicitly to include older visits.
- Kernel reset loses JavaScript handles but does not close Chrome or erase its profile. Re-run setup and claim the tab again.

## API

- Tab: goto, url, title, back, forward, reload, close, screenshot (viewport, clip, or fullPage). back and forward return when history navigation commits, without waiting for another load event.
- Coordinate CUA (tab.cua): click({ x, y, button?, keypress? }), double_click({ x, y, keypress? }), drag({ path: [{ x, y }, ...], keys? }), move({ x, y, keys? }) and scroll({ x, y, scrollX, scrollY, keypress? }) use viewport CSS-pixel coordinates read from a screenshot. click button values are 1=left, 2=middle, 3=right, 4=back and 5=forward. type({ text }) and keypress({ keys: ["Enter"] }) act at the current keyboard focus, not at coordinates. Keys and modifiers are arrays, e.g. ["Control", "a"] for a chord.
- goto navigates to http(s) URLs only, waits for Playwright's default load state and tolerates redirects; read tab.url() afterwards for the final address.
- Semantic locator: CSS, role, text, label, placeholder, test id, filter, first/last/nth, and/or. getByText resolves to the innermost matching element.
- Locator reads: count, allTextContents, innerText, textContent, getAttribute, isEnabled and isVisible. Reads other than count accept timeoutMs where the SDK signature provides it. Reads default to a 1s timeout (actions 5s): innerText, textContent, getAttribute, isEnabled and allTextContents wait up to that long for the element, so pass timeoutMs or call waitFor() first when content renders after an action; count and isVisible return immediately.
- Evaluation: tab.playwright.evaluate(pageFunction, arg?, options?), locator.evaluate(pageFunction, arg?, options?) and locator.evaluateAll(pageFunction, arg?, options?). Use these for inspection and use action APIs for page changes. Page functions may be JavaScript functions or script strings and must use JSON-serializable arguments and results. Strings return their last expression's value; use an async function for await and parentheses around object literals. Function-valued strings are not invoked.
- Locator actions: click, dblclick, downloadMedia, fill, type, press, selectOption, check, uncheck and setChecked. downloadMedia triggers a download for the matched media or file link; it reads the resource from the page origin, so a cross-origin resource whose server sends no CORS headers fails with an error naming that cause instead of downloading — do not retry the same call for it. Actions use strict locator matching, actionability checks, auto-waiting, and a default 5s timeout; use an explicit timeoutMs or waitFor() when a page needs longer.
- click/dblclick/check scroll the element into view and send real input events (options: button, modifiers, force where applicable). A covered element is reported instead of clicked unless force is set.
- Click and keypress actions return after input is dispatched, without waiting for a resulting navigation. Success does not mean the destination has loaded. Use expectNavigation(action, options) when the action should navigate; its navigation timeout is independent of the action timeout.
- locator.press("Enter"), locator.press("Control+a") and locator.type("text") send real keyboard events to the located element. locator.type() inserts at the current selection without clearing existing text and accepts up to 60000 characters per call; use locator.fill() to replace a value or for longer text. fill follows Playwright input/change event behavior; it does not dispatch an extra change event. If typing produces no observable change in the original focused editable element, locator.type() raises INPUT_BLOCKED so the target state can be inspected before continuing. This heuristic does not apply to cua.type() or dom_cua.type().
- For uploads, arm playwright.waitForEvent("filechooser") before clicking, then call chooser.isMultiple() and chooser.setFiles(paths). Paths must name existing absolute files and each call is limited to 100 MB.
- tab.playwright.domSnapshot() and tab.dom_cua.get_visible_dom() return the same Playwright AI accessibility snapshot, including static text and containers alongside controls. Neither filters by role or cursor style. Node ids such as [ref=e12] identify nodes, not a guarantee that clicking them performs an action. Use dom_cua.click({ node_id: "e12" }) or double_click({ node_id: "e12" }) for a listed node, then dom_cua.type({ text }) or dom_cua.keypress({ keys: ["Enter"] }) at the current focus. type and keypress do not accept node_id; focus the target with click first. dom_cua.scroll({ node_id?, x, y }) scrolls the page or a listed node by x/y wheel deltas in CSS pixels (negative scrolls up or left); unlike cua.scroll, its x/y are not viewport coordinates. Take a new snapshot after navigation — node ids from before a navigation are rejected — or when a node id becomes stale.
- iframes: snapshots expand same-origin and cross-origin iframes beneath their "iframe" line; elements inside a frame use Playwright refs such as [ref=f1e3], which dom_cua accepts. tab.playwright.frameLocator(selector), chainable on frame locators, scopes getByRole/getByText/getByLabel/getByPlaceholder/getByTestId/locator to that frame's document.
- Waits live on tab.playwright (not on tab): locator.waitFor({ state }), tab.playwright.expectNavigation(action, options), tab.playwright.waitForEvent("filechooser" | "download"), tab.playwright.waitForURL(url), tab.playwright.waitForLoadState(options), tab.playwright.waitForTimeout(ms). Arm event waiters before the triggering action. A download event confirms that the browser started a download but does not expose its local path. expectNavigation arms its waiter before invoking the action, so fast click-triggered navigations are not missed.
- tab.dev.logs({ filter?, levels?, limit? }) returns console messages and uncaught exceptions captured since the tab was claimed.
- JavaScript dialogs: opening a dialog does not by itself make an already-dispatched click or keypress fail. Call tab.getJsDialog() to read the dialog type and message. While a dialog is open, page operations fail with DIALOG_OPEN instead of waiting for a timeout. Alerts can be dismissed, confirms and before-unload dialogs can be accepted or dismissed, and prompts require text when accepted. A dialog handle applies only to the dialog that was read; get a new handle if it has closed or been replaced. Claiming a tab that already shows a JavaScript dialog fails with DIALOG_OPEN: Chrome shows that dialog to the user and only the user can close it, so ask them to close it, then list open tabs and claim again. Releasing or finalizing a tab while its dialog is open leaves the dialog for the user.
- A claimed tab that is closed, crashed, or whose debugger the user revoked reports STALE_TAB on the next command; claim a tab again to continue.
- Screenshots return JPEG bytes, mimeType and metadata with the original image dimensions, viewport, device pixel ratio and CSS-pixel coordinate space. Pass the complete object to nodeRepl.emitImage(await tab.screenshot()) so metadata stays attached to the image. Only a viewport screenshot is directly usable as cua coordinate space; for clip and fullPage captures the metadata origin names the document point of the image's top-left pixel.
- Clipboard and raw CDP are not exposed.

- Browser transport, serialization, snapshot truncation and screenshot budgets are runtime details rather than model-facing controls.`;
