/**
 * 4d — React wiring for the local-files bridge.
 *
 * Owns the whole lifecycle the design doc describes: probe the context, restore
 * a stored grant silently when the browser allows it, otherwise wait for a real
 * click, then run {@link LocalFilesBridge} bound to the active session.
 *
 * Three rules here come from measurement, not preference:
 *  - `requestPermission()` consumes user activation, so a `prompt` state can
 *    only be cleared from inside a click handler — never from an effect.
 *  - Session-scoped registration emits no workspace event, so nothing outside
 *    this hook will report that the bridge came or went; this status is the
 *    only source of truth.
 *  - Registration needs a live session AND a live ACP channel, so a granted
 *    handle is kept even when no session exists yet, and the bridge starts the
 *    moment one appears.
