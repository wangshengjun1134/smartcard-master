 *
 *   871x490  q=0.75  16.5 KiB  both models invented characters
 *   959x539  q=0.90  31.7 KiB  both misread the code and the line number
 *   1494x840 q=0.45  31.6 KiB  one model exact, the other off by one digit
 *   1674x941 q=0.35  33.2 KiB  both exact
 *
 * At 959x539 and 1494x840 — the same bytes to a tenth of a KiB — the frame with
 * more pixels and less quality is the readable one. So resolution is what
 * carries small glyphs and quality is what can be spent.
 *
 * The ladder stops at 0.45 because nothing below it has been needed to fit, not
 * because lower is worse: 0.35 read no worse here. It is a conservative floor.
