/**
 * @fileoverview Presentation logic for the agents-and-threads surface.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and testable without a browser, following the same
 * split as `agents-manager-logic.ts`. Two rules it exists to enforce:
 *
 * 1. **The server decides a thread's state; this file only renders it.** The
 *    thread resolver already returns a status *and* the sentence explaining it.
 *    Deriving a second, shorter vocabulary here would give the product two
 *    answers to "why is this blocked", and the shorter one would win because it
 *    is the one on screen.
 * 2. **A label never asserts a cause its reason code does not carry.** Copy
 *    that conflates two causes sends people to fix the wrong thing — Multica
 *    learned this when "runtime offline" wording sent users to reconnect a
 *    machine that was already connected. Each refusal below names its own fix.
