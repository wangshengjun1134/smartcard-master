/**
 * Pin the page clock so anything rendering a wall-clock time is byte-identical

 *
 * Those two passes run minutes apart inside the SAME job -- the base render
 * waits on its own `npm install` first -- so every timestamped view differed on
 * every run purely because of when it was photographed. On PR #11267 that was
 * the entire preview: the one view the compose step flagged as CHANGED,
 * `terminal-turn-error-copy-narrow-dark`, scored exactly 0.02% (the threshold)
 * and the whole diff was a `09:09:28` tip against a `09:18:16` one.
 *
 * What `setFixedTime` actually installs is Playwright's FULL fake clock, not a
 * `Date`-only shim: `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `requestAnimationFrame`,
 * `requestIdleCallback`, `performance` and `Intl` are all replaced. Timers and
 * rAF keep firing, so replay, streaming and `freezeLoopingAnimations` behave
 * normally in outcome -- but two things do change and will cost a debugging
 * session if they are not written down:
 *
 * - `performance.mark`/`measure` return throwaway entries and `getEntries()`
 *   comes back empty, so a capture can never observe a measure-storm.
 * - Every `Date.now()`-delta window in the app is pinned permanently shut:
 *   background-agent grace misses, catalog staleness, retry backoff, live-state
 *   reconcile throttling. Nothing seeds those states today, so nothing fails --
 *   but a scenario that needs one to elapse will hang inside `gotoSession` and
 *   surface as a bare expect timeout. Such a scenario must seed already-expired
 *   timestamps or drive `page.clock.fastForward` / `runFor` itself.
 *
 * `visual-capture-contracts.test.ts` pins that every navigation helper still
 * calls this before `page.goto`; nothing in the visuals suite reads the clock,
 * so a dropped call would otherwise stay green.
