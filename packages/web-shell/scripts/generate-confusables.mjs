// The consumer fold IS the runtime fold (`remoteNameSkeleton`): the
// input is canonicalized at the entrance to NFC (a canonical function,
// so every canonical spelling enters the same representative), the
// table answers first on the composed code point — including, for a
// code point the entrance NFC fused out of a table base plus a mark,
// the longest decomposed prefix whose recomposition IS a table key — a
// table-absent code point falls back to its canonical parts (each with
// its own table chance) and then to NFKD for the compatibility shapes,
// and the pass repeats to a fixed point under a closing NFC. Every
// emitted entry has to satisfy one equation in it:
//
//   value === runtimeFold(key)
//
// Three failures collapse into that equation. A value that is not a fold
// fixed point puts one ink-identical class in two skeletons: a name
// holding the source char and a name holding the value verbatim land
// apart (`%` -> `º/₀`, whose parts decompose to `o/0` and lift the `0`
// to `O`). A value that is not what the key itself folds to would make
// the skeleton depend on which canonical spelling a remote name happens
// to use — but the entrance NFC is a canonical function, so every
// canonical spelling of the key enters the same representative and the
// equation needs no decomposed argument: for NFC-stable keys it is the
// plain fixed-point closure, and for the rest (composition exclusions —
// canonical composites the closing NFC never recomposes, like the
// Hebrew presentation forms) it constrains the value to the fold of
// the key's NFC recomposition. And a fold that cycles never reaches a
// fixed point at all, so what the runtime returns depends on its pass
// cap's parity (`Ț` -> `Ţ`, whose own parts decompose back to `Ț`).

// The entrance NFC makes the phenomenon the old NFD-space solve named
// systematic rather than incidental: 1010 of the 6564 emitted values
// are canonically equivalent to their key — composition exclusions
// like U+FB30 -> U+05D0 U+05BC render exactly like their key because
// the closing NFC never recomposes them. That is not a self-map — the
// arm below compares code points, not ink.

// Mirrors `remoteNameSkeleton`'s own cap: a value that only settles past
// it is one the runtime never reaches. Returns undefined when the fold
// did not settle inside it.
