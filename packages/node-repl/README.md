# @qwen-code/node-repl-mcp

A standalone [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that
exposes a **session-persistent Node.js REPL** as five MCP tools. It runs a real
Node.js kernel in a dedicated child process; top-level bindings, closures, and
module state persist across calls within a session.

This package is **fully independent of `@qwen-code/qwen-code-core`** — any MCP
client (Qwen Code via `mcpServers`, Claude, Codex, etc.) can run it.

## Tools

| Tool                            | Description                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `node_repl`                     | Start one JavaScript cell. `{ code, timeout_ms?, yield_time_ms?, title? }`; yields a cell ID if it remains active. |
| `node_repl_wait`                | Wait for the active cell by ID without cancelling it.                                                              |
| `node_repl_cancel`              | Cancel the active cell by ID; terminate an unresponsive kernel after five seconds.                                 |
| `node_repl_reset`               | Terminate the kernel process and discard all bindings/module state.                                                |
| `node_repl_add_node_module_dir` | Register an extra `node_modules` directory for bare-package resolution.                                            |

### Cell semantics

- Explicit output only: `nodeRepl.write(value)` for text, `nodeRepl.emitImage(png|jpeg|webp)`
  for images; byte payloads may include JSON-serializable `metadata`, which is
  returned immediately before each retained image, independently of the prose
  output budget. Metadata for rejected or omitted images is also omitted.
  `console.*` is captured. Plain expression results are not returned.
- `nodeRepl.cwd` / `homeDir` / `tmpDir` and `nodeRepl.getHeapStatus()` are available.
- Top-level static `import` is not allowed — use dynamic `await import()`.
- Declared bindings stay live across cells: after replacing an observation,
  helpers that captured its binding read the replacement. Helper assignments
  and direct assignments share the same binding, including within one cell.
- Bare packages resolve from the session `cwd` `node_modules` plus any directory
  registered via `node_repl_add_node_module_dir`; package entrypoints use Node
  singleton caching. Local `.js`/`.mjs` reload on each execution.
- Node builtins are importable except `process`/`node:process`. Use
  `(await import('node:module')).createRequire(import.meta.url)` for CommonJS or
  native (N-API) addons.
- Timeout and cancellation normally stop only the active cell. Earlier bindings
  and the kernel process remain available, while new bindings from that cell are
  not committed. If the kernel does not return a terminal result within five
  seconds of cancellation, the host terminates it and reports that all bindings
  were lost. A subsequent cell starts a fresh kernel. External actions may have
  completed, so verify external state before retrying. `node_repl_reset` or a
  real process crash also discards all bindings.
- When the kernel is retained, runtime errors keep completed statement/declarator
  checkpoints; cancellation and timeout restore binding values from cell entry.
  Object mutations and external side effects are not rolled back.

## Usage

Once published, the packaged `bin` is the simplest entry point:

```jsonc
// qwen-code settings.json (or any MCP client)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "node-repl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@qwen-code/node-repl-mcp"],
      "cwd": "/your/workspace",
      "env": { "QWEN_NODE_REPL_ROOTS": "/extra/node_modules/parent" },
    },
  },
}
```

For local development against a build in this repo, point at `dist/index.js`:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "node-repl": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/packages/node-repl/dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/your/workspace",
    },
  },
}
```

The `cwd` you set is the kernel's working directory and the base for bare-package
resolution (`<cwd>/node_modules`).

Environment:

- `QWEN_NODE_REPL_ROOTS` — extra readable roots (path-list, OS delimiter).
- `QWEN_NODE_REPL_DEBUG` — set truthy for stderr debug logging.

### Linux desktop sessions

When using the CUA SDK, start the MCP server with the environment of the desktop
session it will control. The kernel inherits the server's environment at startup;
variables removed by the MCP client cannot be recovered by the SDK. For Codex,
add the following allowlist to the existing server entry in `config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.node_repl]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@qwen-code/node-repl-mcp"]
env_vars = ["DISPLAY", "XAUTHORITY", "DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS", "AT_SPI_BUS_ADDRESS", "XDG_RUNTIME_DIR", "WAYLAND_DISPLAY", "GTK_MODULES", "QT_ACCESSIBILITY", "QT_LINUX_ACCESSIBILITY_ALWAYS_ON"]
```

The client process must already have the correct values. For hosts that use an
explicit `env` map, populate it from that same desktop session; display numbers,
authentication paths, and bus addresses vary by machine and user. Restart the
MCP server after changing its environment. An X11 connection failure is reported
as `desktop_unavailable` by CUA discovery, rather than as an empty desktop.

Uncaught errors preserve a string `code` and bounded `details` text in MCP output,
including action and verification diagnostics. External side effects may already
have happened when an error is thrown; use those diagnostics before retrying.

## Desktop relay

`node-repl-mcp desktop-relay` lends this server to a Qwen Code session running
somewhere else, typically a headless dev box, so the computer-use skill can
drive the desktop you are sitting at. On macOS:

```bash
npx -y @qwen-code/node-repl-mcp@0.1.7 desktop-relay install
```

This installs the server and `@qwen-code/cua-sdk` under `~/.qwen/desktop-relay`
and registers a launchd socket on `127.0.0.1:47821` in inetd mode: nothing runs
until something connects, and each connection gets its own short-lived process.

- **Web Shell.** In a session served by a remote `qwen serve` (started with
  `QWEN_SERVE_CLIENT_MCP_OVER_WS=1`), choose **Use this computer** in the sidebar
  footer. A native dialog on this computer asks for approval; once allowed, the
  relay starts `node_repl` here and registers it for that one session over the
  daemon's reverse tool channel. Disconnect from the same entry.

An approved session can run code on this computer with your permissions and see
and control its screen, exactly as a local `node_repl` can. Every connection is
approved separately; nothing is remembered. `desktop-relay status` shows the last
connection, `desktop-relay uninstall [--purge]` removes the socket (and the
runtime).

If the browser cannot reach the relay, the remote connection may still be
running. Request a local disconnect without using the loopback socket:

```bash
~/.qwen/desktop-relay/node_modules/.bin/node-repl-mcp desktop-relay disconnect
```

This checks the recorded process identity before sending SIGTERM; it does not
download a package. For a custom installation, use that installation's executable
and add `--home <dir>`. The command reports a disconnect request, not a confirmed
shutdown; `desktop-relay status` shows the last recorded state.

## Build & test

```bash
npm run build         # tsc (tsconfig.build.json) + copy runtime assets into dist/runtime
npm run typecheck     # includes the test files
npm test              # vitest: kernel integration, N-API, 100-cell + 10-kernel scale,
                      # line fidelity, hoisting semantics, MCP surface
npm run smoke           # kernel manager + output adapter, in-process
npm run smoke:mcp       # real MCP client <-> built stdio server
npm run smoke:lifecycle # proves the kernel child is reaped on stdin EOF / signals
```

> Run vitest from inside this package. A bare `npx vitest run` from the repo root
> executes every workspace project (tens of thousands of tests) and can exhaust
> the default heap.

## Provenance

Ported from the Qwen Code PR #9499 Node REPL core (kernel, module loader, cell
transform, protocol, security policy, kernel manager). The qwen-coupled result
converter was replaced by `output-adapter.ts`, which emits MCP content blocks.
The empty-in-production trusted-package / sha256-pinning layer was removed
entirely: this runtime has no trusted-package or capability mechanism.
