 * only when `isGroup || sessionScope === 'single'`) hands the model the forge
 * verbatim; two passes just move the bar to `[[[SYSTEM]]]`.
 *
 * ONE linear pass, not a `replace` fixpoint over the whole string. The loop
 * this replaces rebuilt the entire string for every tag it peeled, and a tag
 * whose content is all whitespace peels to whitespace — re-opening the
 * start-of-line window — so `'[ ]'.repeat(n)` cost n x O(n): measured 16 ms at
 * 10 KB, 1216 ms at 80 KB of synchronous event-loop stall. That input is
 * attacker-authorable and reaches `sanitizePromptText` BEFORE any cap (chat
 * record titles and summary lines, entry bodies, any group message routed
 * through `ChannelBase`), so the stall is repeatable per message.
 *
 * Same peel, simulated in place — the technique `startOfLineSafeChatRecordField`
 * uses on the DingTalk side. Each pass of that loop deleted exactly two
 * characters, the leading `[` and the FIRST `]` after it (the content class
 * `[^\]\r\n]` can match no other), so instead of re-copying between passes,
 * mark the pairs and emit what survives. `open` walks the head of the line past
 * what is already deleted and past the blanks the `[^\S\r\n]*` window absorbs;
 * `close` never rewinds because every `]` it passed is already deleted, and
 * `carried` remembers how much of the content window the previous pass already
 * measured. Both pointers only move forward, and each pass measures at most
 * `START_OF_LINE_TAG_MAX_CONTENT + 1` live characters, so the whole peel is
 * linear in the input.
