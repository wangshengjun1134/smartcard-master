# @qwen-code/cua-sdk/computer-use

Computer Use API included in `@qwen-code/cua-sdk`. It uses the typed native
SDK and works in ordinary Node.js or a persistent Node REPL.

## Platform workflows

`await computer.getPlatform()` returns `macos`, `windows`, or `linux` from the
connected driver's inventory. It does not infer the target from the CLI or Node
host and does not capture the desktop. Missing or invalid platform metadata
raises `driver_platform_unavailable`; update the driver and SDK before continuing.

The single [Computer Use Skill](./SKILL.md) contains the complete App workflow
for all three platforms. After changing connections, query the platform again.

## App workflow

On macOS, Linux and Windows, bind an application by name, identifier or installation path. The
handle resolves its current native window or owned dialog and owns targeting internally:

```js
import { ComputerUse } from "@qwen-code/cua-sdk/computer-use";

const computer = await ComputerUse.create();
const app = await computer.getApp("Microsoft Excel");
console.log((await app.getState()).text);
// Use an ID from the returned state.
await app.click(37);
await app.typeText("hello");
console.log((await app.getState()).text);
await computer.close();
```

`getApp()` binds identity without launching. `getState()` can open a discovered
stopped app through the native background launcher; actions never restart an app.
Ambiguous names or identifiers require a unique installation path from
the caller. Public `listApps()` returns only `id`, `displayName` and
`isRunning`; internal process and window addressing stays on the app handle.
Native selection uses focused/main AX windows and sheets on macOS, native
active/stacking order and transient ownership on X11, and foreground/Z-order
plus owned popup relationships on Windows. Ambiguous or unavailable targets
fail without dispatching input. Wayland requires compositor support for window
discovery and activation; an unsupported desktop reports the limitation.

App methods accept short observed IDs or screenshot coordinates, and do not
accept process IDs, window IDs, opaque tokens or delivery options.
`getState()` returns `{ app, window, mode, text, screenshot? }`. Native accessibility projections preserve controls, meaningful state and text
and render compact full/diff/no-change output. macOS additionally removes
redundant layout/text structure and includes immediate menu-bar items. Its
selected open menu supplies nested and disabled commands.
Normal actions do not emit another full tree or image.

App text defaults to at most 12,000 characters; `maxTextChars` (minimum 512)
adjusts the limit. Warnings and truncation notices appear before whole captured
rows. To see more text, call `app.getState({ disableDiff: true, maxTextChars: 24000 })`.
The App retains current short-ID action bindings even when text is truncated.
A traversal-limited capture can return no-change when its captured state is
identical; changed bounded state returns full. Read failures require using only
IDs from the latest observation. Omitted rows do not prove absence.

Call `getState()` after a dialog, sheet or menu opens or closes before acting
on its IDs. A process/window/session change invalidates prior IDs. Every App
observation captures a current screenshot internally so a later AX-only
diff/no-change does not discard the coordinate frame. The default return omits
that image; use `getState({ includeScreenshot: true })` when the caller needs to
inspect it.

Native code selects semantic or synthesized input after checking the target.
App input makes one guarded activation of the exact target, dispatches once and
restores the prior app. Failed, partial, unverifiable and cancelled
possible-dispatch actions are never replayed.
Errors request fresh observation before another action; they do not ask the
model to choose a delivery mode. Argument errors detected before native dispatch
retain their specific correction; uncertain post-dispatch failures retain the
cautious observe-before-retry message.

## macOS text operations

`app.paste(text, { format?, signal? })` pastes once into the current app window.
`format` defaults to `text`; `md` and `html` supply formatted content, and the
receiving app chooses which supplied format it accepts. The clipboard is restored
only while the transaction still owns it, preserving newer external clipboard
changes.
The App method activates the exact window only for the Command-V dispatch and
restores the previous foreground app. The exact-window `computer.paste(...)`
method retains PID-addressed background delivery.

`app.selectText(element, text, { prefix?, suffix?, selection?, signal? })` uses a
current short element ID and selects one exact, case-sensitive text match. Prefix
and suffix are optional immediately adjacent context; no match or multiple matches
fail. `selection` defaults to `text`; `cursor_before` and `cursor_after` place the
insertion point at that boundary. The element must support writable text selection.

```js
await app.selectText(37, "draft", { prefix: "Status: " });
console.log((await app.getState()).text);
// After confirming the intended selection:
await app.paste("ready");
console.log((await app.getState()).text);
```

Both methods return the native action effect. An error, cancellation or completed
dispatch does not establish what changed; observe before deciding whether to retry.
Neither method accepts delivery options. Exact-window callers can use
`computer.paste({ pid, windowId, text, format? })` or
`computer.selectText({ pid, windowId, elementToken, text, prefix?, suffix?, selection? })`.
These operations are macOS-only and reject other driver platforms before mutation.

## Exact-window SDK compatibility

The lower-level `ComputerUse` methods remain available to programmatic clients.
The bundled model Skill uses the App workflow on all platforms. The rest of this document describes the existing exact-window contract.

## Observation revisions

Observation uses the driver's versioned
`accessibility.observation_revision.v1` capability. `ComputerUse` keeps one
revision cursor per exact `pid` and `windowId`. The first successful observation
is full; later calls automatically request a validated `diff` / `no_change`
response from the last successful observation for that surface. Different
windows are isolated, and reconnecting clears every cursor before observation
resumes.

Pass `disableDiff: true` only when a fresh complete tree is required. It maps to
the native force-full flag for that call alone, and a successful response
becomes the next automatic base. The legacy `forceFull` spelling remains a
compatibility alias; passing both names is rejected. If a base is stale, the
native driver returns a full resync and the wrapper adopts the replacement
revision. The wrapper never computes a second semantic diff.

Successful native accessibility reads bounded by traversal limits retain a separate
baseline. Identical captured state returns `no_change`; changed bounded state
returns full, since nodes outside the budget cannot be reported as deleted.
`diagnostics.captureComplete` remains false and `captureTruncated` is true.
Read failures invalidate the baseline and receive one automatic retry, including
failures mixed with truncation. `captureReadComplete` distinguishes them from pure
budget truncation, which does not retry. Current snapshot tokens remain available in
`elements`; when `stableElementIds` is false, use only the latest observation's
tokens. `captureIncompleteDetails` explains the capture limitation.

Drivers that do not advertise the capability keep the legacy full-snapshot
behavior; observations then report `diagnostics.revisionSupported: false`.

Revision and lineage identifiers are internal to `ComputerUse` and are not
returned on `WindowObservation`. Normal callers receive the current `mode`, an
optional `resyncReason`, AX text/elements, and an optional screenshot. Protocol
metrics live under `diagnostics`; the raw native response is not exposed.
`context` preserves native `backgroundInput`, `degraded`, `degradedReason`,
`escalation`, `windowBounds`, `screenshotScale`, `screenshotFrameValid`, and
`screenshotError` when available. Consult this context before deciding whether
pixel input or an explicit foreground request is appropriate. Coordinates for
SDK actions remain screenshot pixels; `windowBounds` describes screen points.
The native revision's `capture_complete` flag takes precedence over a legacy
root-level flag.

Treat a full response as the current captured AX state, subject to capture and
text limits. Apply later diffs to that state; a no-change response leaves it
intact within the captured scope. `elements` remains the current captured
actionable list for retained full, diff, and no-change responses.
While the same stable lineage is retained, tokens for unchanged elements remain
current across all three modes; only removed or replaced element tokens become
invalid.

Text is capped at 12,000 characters by default. `maxTextChars`
(minimum 512) controls this output budget independently of the native
`maxElements` and `maxDepth` capture limits. `diagnostics.textTruncated` and
`textChars` describe the returned text; capture warnings and truncation notices
appear first. Rows are never cut in half. The full captured element array stays
in `elements`, so filter it for the controls or text you need before printing.
For more full text, request `disableDiff: true` with a larger `maxTextChars`.
An omitted row does not prove absence, and the character budget is not a token
count. Do not repeatedly print the entire element array.

Screenshot capture is independent from the observation revision mode.
`includeScreenshot: true` requests the image; `disableDiff: true` requests a
fresh complete AX tree. Combine them only when both outputs are independently
needed.

## Delivery defaults

Actions that support input delivery resolve their mode in this order:

1. the action's explicit `deliveryMode`;
2. `QWEN_CUA_SDK_DEFAULT_DELIVERY_MODE` (`background` or `foreground`);
3. the connected platform's default: Linux permits guarded focus preparation;
   Windows and the macOS exact-window compatibility API retain `background`.

On Linux, ordinary callers omit delivery options. The facade passes the existing
`foreground` permission ceiling internally, allowing the native driver to choose
semantic or target-addressed input and prepare exact-window focus when needed.
This uses the connected platform, not the Node host OS. Explicit overrides remain
available to legacy programmatic clients.

The resolved value is passed to the typed driver for every supported action.
Use the environment default when a whole isolated process, such as a test
worker, should consistently use foreground delivery. A per-action value still
overrides it. Invalid environment values fail facade creation, and the public
JavaScript option remains camelCase: `delivery_mode` is rejected instead of
being silently ignored.

## Exact-window usage

Programmatic clients can still select an exact window from `listWindows()`.
Use application-specific criteria to identify it before dispatching input.

```js
import { ComputerUse } from "@qwen-code/cua-sdk/computer-use";

const computer = await ComputerUse.create(); // configured in-process runtime + trusted session
try {
  const windows = await computer.listWindows();
  const target = windows.find((window) => window.title === "Task document");
  if (!target) throw new Error("Open the task document first");

  const first = await computer.observeWindow({
    pid: target.pid,
    windowId: target.window_id,
  });
  // ... deliver first.text downstream, act on element tokens ...
  await computer.click({ pid: target.pid, elementToken: first.elements[0].element_token });

  const second = await computer.observeWindow({
    pid: target.pid,
    windowId: target.window_id,
  });
  console.log(second.mode); // "diff" | "no_change" | "full"

  await computer.drag({
    pid: target.pid,
    windowId: target.window_id,
    fromX: 100,
    fromY: 100,
    toX: 300,
    toY: 100,
    deliveryMode: "foreground", // explicit last resort when background drag is unavailable
  });

  const complete = await computer.observeWindow({
    pid: target.pid,
    windowId: target.window_id,
    disableDiff: true,
  });
  console.log(complete.mode); // "full"
} finally {
  await computer.close();
}
```

`ComputerUse.connect({ socketPath })` instead binds the same trusted-session
surface to a caller-selected daemon. In-process use inherits the host process's
platform accessibility permissions; daemon use inherits the selected daemon's
identity and permissions.

## Tests

- `npm test` — hermetic facade tests against a fake driver handle and Skill packaging checks.
- `npm run test:e2e` — standalone high-level wrapper run against a real target;
  set `COMPUTER_USE_PID` and `COMPUTER_USE_WINDOW`. It uses an isolated
  configured runtime by default; set `COMPUTER_USE_SOCKET` only when testing a
  specific compatible daemon. Unset target variables skip the suite.
