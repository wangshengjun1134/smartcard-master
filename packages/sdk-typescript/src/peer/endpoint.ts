/**
 * A program's place among the Qwen Code sessions running as this user.
 *
 * Starting an endpoint binds an inbox and publishes a session record, so
 * the program shows up in `qwen sessions ps`, and in the `list_agents` of
 * every session that takes part in cross-session messaging — its
 * `agents.crossSessionMessaging` setting is on, and it was not started with
 * `--bare` or `--safe-mode` — which is also what lets those sessions
 * address it by name from `send_message`. It can address sessions the same
 * way. It keeps a small ledger of what it sent, so the receipts that come
 * back read as state changes rather than as a stream of unrelated notices.
 *
 * What the endpoint is trusted to do is not decided here. A message it
 * sends is held for the receiving session's user to review unless the send
 * presents a controller token the user minted (`controller: true`), or its
 * `fromMode` claims the receiver's own review class — and the receiver's
 * `agents.crossSessionInbound` setting outranks both. Nothing in the record,
 * its `kind` or its `name`, changes that.
