/**
 * Fail a PR's Lint & Static lane when the base branch changed the lint gate
 * after this branch last incorporated it.
 *
 * The lane checks out refs/pull/N/head — the branch alone, a deliberate
 * trade-off recorded above the Checkout step in ci.yml (GitHub rebuilds the
 * merge ref asynchronously and can serve it stale for minutes). A green run
 * therefore proves "the branch passes the gate AS THE BRANCH DEFINES IT",
 * not as the base defines it. When the base changes the gate between branch
 * point and merge, the branch keeps validating with the old gate: #11117
 * flipped the Prettier lane from --write to --check on main while #11216's
 * branch still ran --write; its green was real, the merged tree was red,
 * and every later full-profile PR failed lint for a reason outside its own
 * diff (#11378 cleaned up). Nothing else catches this: main's ruleset
 * requires reviews, not status checks, and the merge queue has been off
 * since 2026-07-02.
 *
 * Gate-defining files only, deliberately NOT package.json /
 * package-lock.json: at 50-100 merges a day a dependency bump lands almost
 * daily, and forcing every in-flight PR to rebase behind one recreates the
 * "require up-to-date branch" treadmill. A prettier/eslint version bump
 * cannot sneak changed semantics past a branch either — both run repo-wide
 * (`--check .`, `eslint .`), so the bumping PR must bring the whole tree
 * under the new semantics in its own run. What can sneak is a change to
 * how the gate RUNS (the lane definitions in lint.js, the configs they
 * read, this check), which is exactly the list below. Rare enough — lint.js
 * saw five commits in the months before this check — that an occasional
 * "rebase, the gate moved" is cheap.
 *
 * Fail-open on API errors: with no required status checks this step is
 * advisory by convention (red means do not merge), and a GitHub API
 * brownout must not hold every PR hostage. The warning stays in the log.
 *
 * Cost: two API calls per gate file (latest base-side commit, then a
 * containment compare). The per-file `commits?path=` lookup is exact where
 * the alternative — scanning one swapped compare's file list — caps at 300
 * files, and a branch a few days behind a repo merging 50-100 PRs a day
 * blows past that, silently dropping gate files from the scan.
