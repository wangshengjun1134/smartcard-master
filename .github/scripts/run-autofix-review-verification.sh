# rounds 1/2/5-7, #10543 x5). Passing the values explicitly takes the

# because nothing in the gate or the report path consumes it, and its

# DID, not who asked for it. Two deterministic checks below (sensitive-area
# footprint here, the bite check after the package tests) plus one advisory
# (test deletion). All three read only git state and run before/around the
# existing deterministic re-checks.

# Sensitive-area footprint: a review round must not EXPAND into CI or
# verification machinery the PR itself was never about — a single review
# comment (any author) must not be able to alter the loop's own guardrails.
# Judged by AREA CLASS, not file: a PR whose own pre-round diff already
# touches a class (an infra PR under takeover) keeps full freedom there;
# a round reaching into a class the PR never touched is rejected. Retryable:
# the repair pass can revert the offending files in a follow-up commit.
# `scripts` sections of workspace manifests are their own class because the
# gate's every command resolves through them (`npm run build/typecheck/
# lint/test`) — a scripts edit can hollow out the gate while every check

# --- Test-weakening gate ----------------------------------------------------
# The advisory above renders in the round report only AFTER the round has
# already been accepted, and the SKILL rule it points at ("deleting or
# weakening tests requires content evidence, not an author's say-so") had no
# deterministic enforcement at all. Relaxing an existing assertion is the
# cheapest way for a fix to reach green while the behaviour it broke goes
# unpinned, and it is structurally invisible to every other check here:
# build/typecheck/lint never read assertions, the package tests run the
# WEAKENED file, and the bite check reads only the tests a round ADDS --
# never the ones it edits away.
#
# CONTRACT. Any pre-existing test file whose DECLARED test surface this
# round shrinks must be named in <workdir>/test-weakening.json -- a JSON
# array of {"path": "<file>", "reason": "<evidence>"} -- or the round is
# rejected, retryably. The gate judges that the claim EXISTS and carries a
# non-trivial reason, never the reason's merit: no semantic oracle is
# available here, and turning a silent edit into an explicit, attributable
# claim is the whole point. The reasons ride into the round report, where
# a maintainer reads them against the diff.
#
# AUTHORITY. The surface is measured by count-test-surface.mjs -- the
# TypeScript compiler's parser over the WHOLE file, never text patterns
# over diff lines -- so comments, strings, regex literals, JSX and line
# breaks are the parser's business and can neither decoy nor hide a token.
# Per file it counts statement-position assertion call chains, test/
# describe registrations with their enabled/disabled state (every collector
# spelling of skip/todo/fails, the x-aliases, a constant skipIf/runIf or
# options object, a body-level unconditional skip(), a disabled describe's
# nesting), and bare early returns ahead of a test body's assertions. The
# script's header is the definition of record. Neither the counter nor its
# parser is the round's to choose: both are staged from the trusted base
# (the parser installed from the base lockfile's pin) and digested there,
# and the digests -- carried in expression context, unreachable from any
# disk write branch code makes later -- are verified here before either
# executes. A mismatch is tampering and rejects non-retryably; an
# instrument that was never digested measures nothing (UNAVAILABLE below).
# The parser is a `.cjs` copy of typescript's single-file build, so its
# loading cannot be steered by a package.json planted beside it.
#
# ATTRIBUTION. Each file's round delta is tip - pre-round - main's own
# contribution. Across a main-derived merge (any parent from the second on
# that origin/main reaches), main's contribution is MAIN'S OWN DELTA,
# measured on main's own side against the merge base; across a
# fast-forwarded main commit it is the commit's own delta. Never a
# three-way splice of the two sides: an auto-merge mixes the round's edits
# into main's contribution and can invent a surface neither side ever had
# -- an un-skip the round made, spliced with a test main added, produces
# an enabled registration that existed in no tree and is then charged to
# somebody. Measuring main where main made it removes that whole class,
# and it makes the two arms one rule: a modify/delete resolved for main
# was already measured from the merge base.
# So a weakening committed before, during, or after a merge of main
# measures the same, an assertion moved within a file nets zero whichever
# commit sequence produced the tip, and main's own delta neither charges
# nor shields the round. An event that moved nothing for the file
# (byte-identical or absent on both sides) is not recorded.
#
# What main did is not always what the merge KEPT, so the contribution is
# clamped by the blob the merge commit actually landed, measured against
# the same merge base. Main's REMOVALS are credited only as far as they
# landed: a round could otherwise merge main, discard its side, and let
# the phantom credit absorb its own removal exactly. Main's ADDITIONS are
# never clamped: they raise the baseline whatever the merge kept, or a
# round that drops what main added during the round gets that removal for
# free. Presence is a running state, not a reading of the newest event.
# Main ADDING the path puts the file in the baseline; so does main moving
# its measured surface; main deleting it takes it out only when the merge
# adopted that deletion. Where both sides MEASURE to nothing -- the Python
# and Rust shapes, and equally a JS file that declares nothing -- movement
# is read from the bytes instead, since "the surface did not move" is
# unmeasurable there. That reads main touching such a file at all as a
# contribution, so a file an earlier round deleted is charged again: one
# ack entry answers it, where the alternative is losing the deletion arm,
# the only arm those shapes have.
# What none of this can see is identity: main removing one assertion while
# the resolution puts it back and drops a different one nets to zero, the
# same way an assertion moved within a file always has.
#
# The model assumes main's side is MAIN's. It stops being main's if the
# round's own work reaches origin/main WHILE THE LOOP IS STILL RUNNING --
# the PR squash-merged or cherry-picked mid-round -- because main's chain
# then carries the round's authorship while the merge base does not, and
# measuring the round against it cancels the round's own removals. (Main
# MERGING the branch is self-correcting: the merge base carries the same
# commit, so the two cancel.) A guard was written for it and removed:
# every history these fixtures can build measures correctly without one,
# so it was code no test could reach. The residual is bounded by the same
# thing that bounds the flake carve-out -- a round whose work has already
# landed has nothing left to gate.
# Assertions are counted per file; registrations by kind and title as
# multisets, so un-skipping one test never licenses silencing another,
# while a brand-new todo/skip registration is the round's own and charges
# nothing. Every file is measured under ONE name end to end: a round that
# RENAMES a test file is measured as the deletion of the old path plus a
# new file at the new one, so the rename costs one ack entry naming the
# old path -- deliberately fail-closed, and never silent, since whatever
# shrank inside the destination rides into the round report as the
# reason a maintainer reads against the diff. Following a name across a
# round's own renames is a non-goal: it is a second rename tracker layered
# on git's own, and every reading of it that this gate tried disagreed
# with git in some history shape. A parentless commit in the round's
# history is the round's own authorship, measured against the empty tree.
#
# SIGNALS, one entry per file, the first that applies: the file was
# deleted (held by the baseline -- pre-round, or landed by main during the
# round -- and absent at the tip); a baseline-enabled registration now
# disabled; net assertions removed (an early return planted ahead of them
# counts here: the runner then reports the test passed having asserted
# nothing); net enabled tests removed. Files are selected by NAME: `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`,
# `test_*.py`, and the `tests/*.rs` / `*_test.rs` / `*_tests.rs` shapes,
# snapshots excluded. Non-JS shapes measure a zero surface and are judged
# by the deletion arm alone. A test surface only a runner can enumerate --
# a Rust `#[cfg(test)]` module inside a production file, a suite registered
# under a condition -- is outside this gate by design.
#
# NOT MEASURED, by design: whether an assertion is REACHABLE (dead code, a
# condition false in CI, a helper never called), condition-valued guards
# (`.skipIf(cond)`, `skip(cond, reason)`, `if (cond) ctx.skip()` -- this
# repository's environment-guard idiom, which the runner reports as
# skipped), and options or collector names carried by a binding. Those are
# runtime facts; the package test run and the bite check are the
# runner-backed instruments, and this gate certifies only what it
# measures: the declared surface.
#
# Fails OPEN on the measured signals -- a counter or parser that is absent
# or unverifiable, or a history the walk cannot read, skips them with a
# logged UNAVAILABLE -- and never on a whole-file deletion or typechange,
# which the pre-round->tip pair proves without the walk; an enumeration git
# itself refuses fails CLOSED there, since the absence of deletions cannot
# then be certified.

# Bite check: run this round's changed tests against the PRE-ROUND tree
# (origin/<branch> sources + the round's test files). If EVERY changed test
# also passes there, the tests demonstrate nothing — the classic shape of a
# plausible-but-false finding implemented as a "fix" whose regression test
# was green all along.
#
# INTENT decides the consequence, and intent is read from the round's own
# machine-readable artifacts, not inferred from the diff shape: a round is
# a DEFECT-CLAIM round only when resolved-comments.txt marks a finding
# resolved-in-code whose thread is Critical-tagged or belongs to a
# CHANGES_REQUESTED review (matched in rc.json/rv.json). Those rounds get a
# non-retryable rejection on all-green — the 60-minute repair pass cannot
# make a nonexistent defect reproduce; the next full round re-reads the
# feedback with the evidence in LAST_REJECTION and can decline or escalate
# instead. Every OTHER src+test round (a refactor pinning existing
# behavior, an optional cleanup adding coverage) legitimately produces
# all-green pre-round tests, so all-green there is a gate-authored ADVISORY
# in the report, never a rejection.
# Scope guards (all fail OPEN — only the clean "ran and all passed" verdict
# has consequences):
#   - Runnable unit tests only: *.test.* / *.spec.* files. Snapshots and
#     integration-tests/ are not directly runnable here.
#   - Single-package rounds only: on the detached pre-round tree, gitignored
#     dist/ still carries the ROUND's build, so a cross-package fix leaks
#     into the baseline through dist-resolved imports and would read as
#     "no bite" — the same dist confound that A/B-exempts typecheck above.
#     Same-package imports resolve through vitest src aliases and relative
#     paths, which the detach does revert.
#   - A test that fails on the pre-round tree for ANY reason (assertion,
#     collection, import of a round-added symbol) counts as biting; the
#     check's power is the all-green case, which no honest defect fix
#     produces. KNOWN LIMIT, deliberate: the verdict is existential over
#     the batch, so in a mixed Critical round one genuinely biting test
#     vouches for the batch — binding each behavior to its own probe needs
#     per-test result parsing and is out of scope here. Also known: a
#     re-raised finding whose fix already sits in origin/<branch> is
#     legitimately all-green (SKILL directs re-verified items into
#     resolved-comments.txt); the rejection text tells the agent to
