# Push the round's commit to the PR head and post the round report.
#
# The body below is the 'Push and report' step of review-address in
# .github/workflows/qwen-autofix.yml — the inline block it came from (626
# lines, ~41 KB at the move), its long comments since migrated to
# qwen-autofix.md pointers like the rest of the workflow. The file it left
# is within a few KB of the repo's 470,000-byte gate, and GitHub stops starting
# runs past 512,000 without saying so (.github/scripts/check-workflow-size.sh).
# No absolute size is
# quoted here on purpose — main moves it every day, and a number that decays is
# how this comment earned three review rounds. It is also
# the step docs/design/autofix-gate-runner-isolation.md moves into its own
# credentialed `publish` job — carrying it as a file makes that a small diff.
#
# DELIVERY: this file is never staged, copied or executed from disk at run
# time. The stage step reads it from the trusted-base checkout, before any
# branch code has run, and passes the TEXT through step output; 'Push and
# report' runs those bytes. That is the delivery the inline block had — the
# workflow file's own bytes — and the one upsert-deferred-issue.sh uses. With
# no agent-writable copy on this shared host there is nothing to digest, type
# check or re-open, and no check→use window between those steps. Keep it that
# way: `bash <path>` here would hand the PAT-bearing step to whatever the
# branch left at that path.
#
# INPUTS: the body runs with the step's environment, exactly as the inline
# block did — the `env:` bindings on 'Push and report' plus review-address's
# job-level `env:`. There is deliberately no enumeration here: the previous one
# went stale within a round (it omitted ISSUE, TAKEOVER_LABEL,
# TAKEOVER_COMMAND and TAKEOVER_MAX_ROUNDS), and a list that can rot is worse
# than the two places that cannot.
#
# GitHub runs `run:` blocks as `bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail`, so the
# same flags are set here — deliberately without `-u`: the body reads optional
# step outputs unguarded, and adding `-u` would change behaviour rather than
# preserve it.
#
# SHELLCHECK: `scripts/lint.js --shellcheck` adds `--enable=all` on top of
# `--severity=style`, which every script here trips (26 findings for
# run-autofix-review-verification.sh, 9 for upsert-deferred-issue.sh, 32 here)
# and which the lane cannot fail on — its pipeline ends in `sed`. This file is
# clean at the lane's severity WITHOUT `--enable=all`, which is the bar its
# siblings meet, and the three codes below are what that bar reports:
#   SC1007 — the empty prefix assignments before the clean-child launches
#            (`VAR= VAR= cmd`) clear those variables for one command. That is
#            the intent, not a mistyped assignment. Spelled generically here
#            on purpose: a contract test anchors its slice on the literal
#            launch line, and repeating it in a comment moves that anchor.
#   SC2016 — single-quoted `${...}` is passed verbatim to jq programs, GraphQL
#            queries and comment bodies; expanding them here would break them.
#   SC2155 — real, and pre-existing: two `export X="$(cmd)"` sites mask the
#            command's exit status. Splitting them changes what `set -e` does
#            at those lines, so it belongs in a change that can be reviewed as
#            a behaviour change rather than hiding inside a move.
