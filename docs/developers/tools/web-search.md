# Web Search

Qwen Code provides web search two ways:

1. **Built-in `web_search` tool** — backed by the DashScope Responses API server-side search. On by default at startup for supported ModelStudio and OpenAI-compatible DashScope configurations; no extra provider or MCP setup.
2. **MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations** — connect any external search service (Tavily, GLM, and others). Use this when your provider cannot back the built-in tool.

## Built-in `web_search`

The built-in tool issues a self-contained search request to a small auxiliary model with DashScope's server-side `web_search` (and `web_extractor`) tools, and returns the narrated findings plus source URLs.

### When it turns on by itself

If you configured nothing under `tools.webSearch`, the tool registers whenever the model you are running can back the search request with the same credentials:

| Alibaba ModelStudio → **Coding Plan**                                                                                      | off — its endpoint is not verified for this API |
| An OpenAI-compatible `modelProviders` or Custom Provider entry on a recognized DashScope Responses host, with a direct key | on                                              |
| Third-party providers (OpenRouter, DeepSeek, ModelScope, …), custom endpoints on other hosts, local models                 | off                                             |

Searches bill the same key as your main model. Permission handling follows the active approval mode and rules; in `default` approval mode the first search asks for confirmation. When your provider cannot back the tool, it simply does not appear at startup — no startup warning.

To turn it off:

```json
{ "tools": { "webSearch": { "enabled": false } } }
```

or `ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH=false`. Bare mode and safe mode always disable it.

### Configuring it explicitly

Point the tool at a ModelStudio Standard/Token Plan or another verified DashScope Responses entry. This is useful when your main model runs on another provider and you also hold a separate supported DashScope key. Coding Plan hosts are excluded from automatic activation because the Responses search tools are not verified there. You can opt in explicitly with `tools.webSearch.model`; if the endpoint does not serve them, the first search fails loudly. Use an MCP search provider if you do not want to rely on that unverified path.

The count is shared with subagents and resets when the session changes (`/clear`, `/resume`, branching). Once it is reached, further searches are skipped and the model is told to continue with what it has gathered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Env-only configuration (no settings.json)

For environments where you cannot write a settings file (locked-down containers, CI
with env injection only), the tool can be configured entirely through environment
variables — no `modelProviders` entry needed:

```bash
export ENABLE_WEB_SEARCH=true
export WEB_SEARCH_MODEL=qwen3.8-flash
export WEB_SEARCH_BASE_URL=https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-...        # or set WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY instead
```

`WEB_SEARCH_BASE_URL` mirrors a `modelProviders` entry's `baseUrl` and must be a
DashScope-compatible endpoint; when it is set, it takes precedence over
`modelProviders` resolution and `WEB_SEARCH_MODEL` is used as the plain DashScope
model id. The API key is read from `WEB_SEARCH_API_KEY` if set, otherwise from
`DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`. Misconfiguration still surfaces as a startup notice.

Notes:

- The selector must resolve to a DashScope-compatible `modelProviders` entry carrying a direct API key via `envKey`. Your main model can be any provider — only the search side request needs a DashScope entry. Qwen OAuth cannot back the tool.
- Which providers can activate the tool is decided at startup. Once active, the search backend follows the currently selected model on the next search; switching to an unsupported provider makes that invocation fail, while switching from a session where the tool was absent still requires a restart to register it.
- Automatic host detection intentionally accepts only known DashScope regional, Token Plan MaaS, and internal Alibaba hosts. Generic `*.alicloudapi.com` gateways and `DASHSCOPE_PROXY_BASE_URL` are excluded because they are not known to forward the Responses search tools.
- If enabled explicitly but misconfigured, the tool stays off and a startup notice explains which condition failed. Automatic activation never emits a notice.
- Searches bill your DashScope key (`usage.x_tools` counts). Auto approval mode (the default) lets the classifier approve searches without prompting; in `default` approval mode the tool asks, and approving with "always allow" persists a standard `WebSearch` permission rule, like other tools.
- There is no client-side model allowlist; a model the Responses endpoint does not serve fails loudly on first use.
- A search that exceeds its time budget returns what arrived as a partial result once at least one search call has completed; if the budget expires before the first search call finishes, the tool reports a timeout error instead, because narration with no executed search is not auditable evidence. When a search call did complete but the narrated answer never arrived, the result carries at most 6,000 characters of the page text the agent had read, labeled as raw page content.
- The per-session cap counts `web_search` tool calls, not the searches one call runs internally, and a call that fails still counts because the request was sent. A skipped call is not an error: it tells the model the budget is used and to ask you to raise `tools.webSearch.maxPerSession` if more searches are genuinely needed.

## MCP alternatives

If your provider cannot back the built-in tool, web search is available by connecting an external MCP server — see the services below.

## ⚠️ Historical Breaking Change: original built-in `web_search` removed

> **Affected versions:** `V0.0.7+` through the last release with the original multi-provider built-in web search.

The original built-in `web_search` tool (Tavily/Google/GLM/DashScope multi-provider) and its configuration were **removed**. The built-in tool documented above is a different implementation with different configuration. If you were using any of the following, migrate either to the new built-in tool (DashScope) or to MCP:

| Removed                                                                | What to do                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `webSearch` block in `settings.json`                                   | Configure an MCP server in `mcpServers` instead (see below)     |
| `advanced.tavilyApiKey` in `settings.json`                             | Use the [Tavily MCP server](#tavily-websearch)                  |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` environment variable                                  | Use the [Tavily MCP server](#tavily-websearch)                  |
| `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` for web search                                     | Use the [built-in `web_search` tool](#built-in-web_search)      |
| `GLM_API_KEY` for web search                                           | Use the [GLM WebSearch Prime MCP](#glm-websearch-prime-zhipuai) |
| `--tavily-api-key` / `--glm-api-key` / `--dashscope-api-key` CLI flags | Configure via `mcpServers` in `settings.json`                   |

### Firecrawl

The official hosted MCP server from Firecrawl, providing web search, page scraping, website crawling and mapping, browser interaction, and file parsing. Search results can include each page's content as Markdown, so the model can read its sources without a separate fetch step. The hosted server works without an API key for search, scrape, and parse. Search queries, the URLs you ask it to read, and any files you parse are sent to Firecrawl.

- **Documentation:** https://docs.firecrawl.dev/mcp-server
- **Cost:** No API key needed for search, scrape, and parse (daily limit per IP); paid plans for higher limits
- **Get API Key:** https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys
- **Best for:** Web search where the model also needs to read the pages it finds, and trying MCP web search without an API key

#### Available Tools

- `firecrawl_search` — Web search, optionally returning each result's page content as Markdown
- `firecrawl_scrape` — Get a single page as clean Markdown
- `firecrawl_parse` — Convert a local file (PDF, Word, spreadsheet, and more) to Markdown

With an API key, the server also offers tools to map and crawl websites, interact with pages (click, type, navigate), and search developer sources like GitHub issues and docs.

#### Setup

**Method 1: CLI command (Remote MCP)**

```bash
qwen mcp add firecrawl \
  -t http \
  "https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}"
```

To try it without a key, leave out the `-H` line. You get `firecrawl_search`, `firecrawl_scrape`, and `firecrawl_parse` within a daily per-IP limit.

**Method 2: `settings.json` (Remote MCP)**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl": {
      "httpUrl": "https://mcp.firecrawl.dev/v2/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `${FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}` with your actual API key, or set it as an environment variable. If the key is empty, the server still connects but only offers the three keyless tools.

**Method 3: `settings.json` (Local NPX)**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
