# SSE Event Bus & Backpressure

## Overview

`EventBus` (`packages/acp-bridge/src/eventBus.ts`) is the per-session in-memory pub/sub that feeds the daemon's `GET /session/:id/events` SSE route. It assigns each event a monotonic id, buffers recent events in a bounded ring for `Last-Event-ID` replay, fans published events out to all subscribers, applies per-subscriber backpressure (warning at 75% live queue fill / serialized-byte fill, eviction at the cap), and emits subscriber-local synthetic frames (`client_evicted`, `slow_client_warning`) that the SDK treats as first-class events but the bus marks **without an `id`** so they do not consume a slot in the per-session sequence.

`EventBus` is currently package-private to `acp-bridge` and consumed by the bridge factory through one closed-over instance per session. A future refactor (called out at line 150–159 of `eventBus.ts`) will lift it to a top-level building block so channels, dual-output, and future WebSocket transports can subscribe through the same bus instead of running parallel streams.

## Responsibilities

- Assign per-session monotonic event ids starting at 1.
- Buffer the last `ringSize` events for replay on subscribe-with-`lastEventId`.
- Fan published events out to ≤ `maxSubscribers` concurrent subscribers.
- Apply per-subscriber bounded queues; drop subscribers that overflow the live frame cap or live serialized-byte cap with a synthetic `client_evicted` terminal frame.
- Emit `slow_client_warning` once per overflow episode at 75% live frame fill or live serialized-byte fill, with 37.5% hysteresis to prevent repeated warnings.
- Tear subscriptions down promptly on `AbortSignal.abort()`.
- Cleanly close every subscriber on bus close (e.g. session teardown).
- Never throw from `publish` (the contract is "publish is always safe to call").

### `BridgeEvent`

```ts
interface BridgeEvent {
  id?: number; // monotonic per session; absent on synthetic terminal frames
  v: 1; // EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION
  type: string; // one of the 53 known types or future-extensible
  data: unknown; // payload (typed per-type by the SDK; see 09-event-schema.md)
  _meta?: { serverTimestamp?: number; [key: string]: unknown }; // stamped by EventBus.publish
  originatorClientId?: string; // set when the event derives from a clientId-stamped request
}
```

### `SubscribeOptions`

```ts
interface SubscribeOptions {
  lastEventId?: number; // replay from after this id (Last-Event-ID resume)
  signal?: AbortSignal; // aborts the subscription promptly
  maxQueued?: number; // per-subscriber live frame backlog cap; default 256
}
```

`subscribe()` returns an `AsyncIterable<BridgeEvent>`. The SSE route consumes it with `for await`. Registration is **synchronous** — by the time `subscribe()` returns, the subscriber is already attached, so a `publish()` that races with the consumer's first `next()` is still delivered.

The live byte cap is a bus-level constructor option for tests / embedded callers only. It is not exposed as an HTTP query parameter, SDK option, CLI flag, or capability because clients must not be able to raise the daemon's memory budget.

### `BoundedAsyncQueue`

The per-subscriber queue. Two pivotal behaviors:

- **Live caps are on live items only.** Items inserted via `forcePush()` carry a `forced: true` tag per entry and never count toward `liveCount` or `liveBytes`. This lets the `Last-Event-ID` replay path force-push hundreds of historical frames into a fresh subscriber without immediately tripping the live caps and evicting the just-resumed subscriber.
- **`liveCount` and `liveBytes` are maintained as fields**, not derived from `forcedInBuf` position. The earlier position-based heuristic broke when `slow_client_warning` started force-pushing mid-stream (warnings go to the BACK of the queue, not the front like replays). Per-entry `forced` tags are position-independent; live entries also store their serialized byte estimate so draining the queue decrements `liveBytes`.
- **Serialized bytes are estimated lazily.** `push()` computes `Buffer.byteLength(JSON.stringify(event), 'utf8')` only when the event will be buffered. If a subscriber is already awaiting `next()`, the event is delivered directly and no byte estimate is computed. If serialization fails, the daemon emits a best-effort stderr diagnostic and that event skips byte accounting while preserving `publish()`'s never-throws contract; it still counts toward the live frame cap.

`push(value, getBytes, fallback?)` returns an accepted / rejected result instead of blocking or throwing. Frame overflow rejects with `queue_overflow`. An empty live queue admits one oversized event unchanged. For a nonempty queue that would exceed its byte cap, the optional fallback can supply a smaller copy: MCP App `tool_call` / `tool_call_update` frames drop whole `rawOutput.html` to `''` while retaining a required nonempty `fallbackText`. If that copy fits, the subscriber stays connected; otherwise byte overflow rejects with `queue_bytes_overflow`. A missing or empty text fallback does not qualify for degradation. Direct delivery and the replay ring keep the original frame; the compaction replay window has its own independent budget policy. The admitted copy keeps the published id, so a queued subscriber may receive a different payload than the ring holds at that id. Resuming after that id does not redeliver it; a client requiring the document must explicitly re-page the persisted transcript (subject to its page budget). `forcePush(value)` bypasses both caps. `close({drain?: boolean})` drains pending items by default; abort-path passes `drain: false` to drop them immediately.

## Workflow

### Publish

    RA --> WARN
    WARN -->|yes| FW["log slow_client_warning; force-push frame; warned = true"]
    WARN -->|no| NEXT
    FW --> NEXT
```

`publish` never throws. Closing the bus mid-publish (the shutdown path closes per-session buses before awaiting `channel.kill()`) returns `undefined` rather than throwing because the agent may still emit `sessionUpdate` notifications in the small window between bus close and channel kill.

```

If `subs.size >= maxSubscribers` at subscribe time, `SubscriberLimitExceededError` is thrown — the SSE route catches it and serializes a `stream_error` synthetic frame to the rejected client so they do not see a silent empty stream. Returning an empty iterable instead would leave operators without visibility into "some clients get events, some do not" under load.

### Ring-eviction → `state_resync_required` (the recovery flow)

When a consumer reconnects with `Last-Event-ID: N` and the ring's earliest surviving event has `id > N + 1`, the events in `[N+1, earliestInRing-1]` were evicted before the consumer reconnected. The naïve replay would silently succeed with a non-contiguous suffix, the SDK reducer would keep applying deltas as if the stream were contiguous, and its state would diverge from the daemon's truth — with no terminal signal.

Implemented in `EventBus.subscribe()`:

1. First check `opts.lastEventId >= this.nextId`. If true, the client cursor is
   from an older bus epoch (daemon restart / EventBus reconstruction), so the
   bus emits `reason: 'epoch_reset'` and replays the whole current ring.
2. Otherwise compute `earliestInRing = this.ring[0]?.id`.
3. If `earliestInRing > opts.lastEventId + 1`, force-push a synthetic frame **before** the replay frames:
   ```jsonc
   {
     "v": 1,
     "type": "state_resync_required",
     "data": {
       "reason": "ring_evicted",
       "lastDeliveredId": <opts.lastEventId>,
       "earliestAvailableId": <earliestInRing>
     }
   }
   ```
4. Continue the normal replay loop afterwards.

Critical contracts (and what the #4360 review corrected):

- **No `id`** — same no-slot pattern as `client_evicted`, so it does not occupy a slot in the per-session monotonic sequence other subscribers observe.
- **Stream stays open** — unlike `client_evicted` (genuinely terminal), `state_resync_required` is recovery-oriented. Replay + live frames continue flowing afterward.
- **Reducer auto-skips deltas** — the SDK side flips `awaitingResync = true` and applies only `state_resync_required`, the terminal frames, and full-state snapshots until consumer code calls `loadSession` and clears the flag. See [`09-event-schema.md`](./09-event-schema.md) for `RESYNC_PASSTHROUGH_TYPES`.
- **Network-friendly** — frames stay on the wire so the SDK can compute a "what you missed" diff later if it wants to. No extra reconnect cycle is required.

### Eviction terminal flow

When a subscriber's live backlog reaches a cap and the next `push()` rejects:

1. Mark `sub.evicted = true`.
2. Build eviction data, emit `logSubscriberEvicted(evictionData)` to stderr, then construct a `client_evicted` frame **without `id`**. Frame overflow uses `reason: 'queue_overflow'`; byte overflow uses `reason: 'queue_bytes_overflow'`. Both include `queueSize`, `maxQueued`, `queuedBytes`, and `maxQueuedBytes`; byte overflow also includes `eventBytes`.
3. `queue.forcePush(evictionFrame)` so the consumer iterator sees one terminal frame.
4. `queue.close()` so iteration unwinds after the terminal frame.
5. Call `sub.dispose()` — removes from `subs` and detaches the `AbortSignal` listener; without this cleanup, stalled consumers' closures remain live until `AbortSignal` garbage collection.

### Abort flow

`AbortSignal.abort()` → `onAbort()`:

1. `queue.close({drain: false})` — drop buffered items so the SSE route does not keep serializing events to a socket nobody is listening to.
2. `dispose()` — idempotent through a `disposed` flag.

Already-aborted signals at subscribe time call `onAbort()` synchronously before returning the iterator.

## State & Lifecycle

- `nextId` starts at 1 and only ever increments. `lastEventId` getter returns `nextId - 1`.
- `ring` is bounded; eviction-by-shift is O(n) once full. At `ringSize=8000` that measures in low milliseconds on high-volume sessions — well below per-frame latency budget. A circular-buffer refactor is deferred until profiling flags it or operators increase `--event-ring-size` by an order of magnitude.
- `close()` flips `closed`, closes every subscriber's queue, and clears `subs`. Subsequent `publish()` / `subscribe()` are no-ops (`publish` returns undefined; `subscribe` returns `emptyAsyncIterable`).
- Each session owns one `EventBus`. Bus close happens before `channel.kill()` so in-flight publishes during shutdown return undefined rather than throwing.

## Dependencies

- Consumed by `packages/acp-bridge/src/bridge.ts` (`BridgeClient.sessionUpdate` / `BridgeClient.extNotification` → `events.publish(...)`).
- Consumed by `packages/cli/src/serve/routes/sse-events.ts` (SSE route handler → `events.subscribe(...)` then formats `BridgeEvent` to SSE wire frames).
- CLI consumers import the event bus directly from `@qwen-code/acp-bridge/eventBus`.
- SDK consumer: `packages/sdk-typescript/src/daemon/sse.ts` (`parseSseStream`), then `asKnownDaemonEvent` (see [`09-event-schema.md`](./09-event-schema.md), [`13-sdk-daemon-client.md`](./13-sdk-daemon-client.md)).

## Configuration

- `--event-ring-size <n>` — per-session ring depth; soft-capped at `MAX_EVENT_RING_SIZE = 1_000_000`.
- Subscriber `?maxQueued=N` query parameter on `GET /session/:id/events`, range `[16, 2048]`. SDK clients pre-flight `caps.features.slow_client_warning` before opting in.
- `EventBus(..., { maxQueuedBytes })` constructor option exists only for tests / embedded callers. Default is 2 MiB and invalid values throw `TypeError`. There is deliberately no `?maxQueuedBytes` query parameter.
- `BridgeOptions.eventRingSize` (overrides daemon default for embedded usage).
- Capability tags: `session_events`, `slow_client_warning`, `typed_event_schema`.

## Client Integration: `Last-Event-ID` Reconnect

### Wire Format

Every id-bearing SSE frame emitted by `GET /session/:id/events` includes an `id:` line:

```
id: 42
event: session_update
data: {"id":42,"v":1,"type":"session_update","data":{...},"_meta":{"serverTimestamp":1719000000000}}

```

Synthetic/terminal frames (`state_resync_required`, `replay_complete`, `client_evicted`, `slow_client_warning`, `stream_error`) are emitted **without** an `id:` line — they do not advance the per-session monotonic sequence.

### Reconnect Protocol

When a client reconnects after a disconnect, it sends the last successfully received event id as the `Last-Event-ID` HTTP header:

```
GET /session/:id/events HTTP/1.1
Last-Event-ID: 42
Accept: text/event-stream
```

The daemon's `EventBus` replays all events from the ring buffer whose `id > Last-Event-ID`, then transitions to live delivery. A `replay_complete` synthetic frame marks the boundary between replay and live:

```jsonc
// no id: line — synthetic
{
  "v": 1,
  "type": "replay_complete",
  "data": { "replayedCount": 7, "lastReplayedEventId": 49 },
}
```

### Replay Behavior

| `Last-Event-ID: N` where `ring[0].id > N+1`  | Gap detected — `state_resync_required` (`reason: 'ring_evicted'`) emitted before replay of surviving suffix. SDK must call `loadSession` to recover a bounded replay snapshot window; the returned `compactedReplay` may begin with `history_truncated` if older in-memory replay entries were dropped. |
| `Last-Event-ID: N` where `N >= nextId`       | Epoch reset (daemon restart) — `state_resync_required` (`reason: 'epoch_reset'`) emitted, then full ring replay.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Validation Rules

The daemon parses `Last-Event-ID` strictly:

- Only pure decimal digit strings are accepted (e.g. `"42"`).
- Non-numeric, negative, fractional, or overflow values (beyond `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`) are silently rejected — the stream starts live-only and the daemon logs a breadcrumb.
- The `retry: 3000` directive tells conformant `EventSource` implementations to wait 3 seconds before reconnecting.

### Backward Compatibility

The `Last-Event-ID` mechanism is fully opt-in:

- Clients that never send the header receive a live-only stream identical to pre-resume behavior.
- Older SDK versions that do not track event ids continue to work.
- The `replay_complete` frame is synthetic (no `id:`), so it does not confuse id-unaware consumers.

### Browser `EventSource` Limitation

The native browser `EventSource` API automatically tracks the last `id:` field and sends it on reconnect. However, it **cannot** set custom headers (e.g. `Authorization: Bearer`). Clients that require authentication must use raw `fetch()` + manual SSE parsing (as the TypeScript SDK does via `parseSseStream`) rather than `EventSource`. The SDK's `RestSseTransport` demonstrates this pattern — it sets `Last-Event-ID` as an explicit HTTP header on the `fetch()` call.

## Caveats & Known Limits

- **Synthetic frames have no `id`.** SDK consumers using `Last-Event-ID` resume only record frames with ids; `slow_client_warning`, `client_evicted`, `state_resync_required`, and `replay_complete` do not advance the cursor and do not consume per-session sequence numbers. If two id-bearing live frames have a real gap, handle it through the ring-eviction / epoch-reset resync path rather than treating it as a private synthetic frame.
- `client_evicted` is **per-subscriber**, not per-session. The same client can reconnect.
- `BoundedAsyncQueue` iterator is **not safe for concurrent drivers** — two simultaneous `.next()` calls would race for the same event. Daemon usage is sequential (`for await ... of` in the SSE route handler), so this is safe in production.
- The bus is currently package-private; channels and the web UI must subscribe through the daemon's HTTP SSE route, not by reaching into the bus directly. Stage 1.5 will lift this.
