# REST API integration guide

For teams putting Qwen Code inside their own product over HTTP: run `qwen serve`
as a backend and drive it from your own front end.

This page is the entry point. The curated
[Daemon REST API reference](./daemon-rest-api-reference.md) covers the stable
integration surface and links to its OpenAPI 3.1 contract. The full protocol is
[`qwen-serve-protocol.md`](./qwen-serve-protocol.md); the internals are the
[daemon deep dive](./daemon/00-index.md); a runnable TypeScript walkthrough is
[`examples/daemon-client-quickstart.md`](./examples/daemon-client-quickstart.md).

## Which paths exist

Seven ways to build on the daemon, separated by one question — **how much of the
front end do you own?**

| Path                                 | You own                                      | Status                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Headless `qwen -p` and ACP over stdio for editors are separate integration
paths. Channels and extensions can also run through the daemon; see the
[channel guide](../users/features/channels/overview.md) and
[Extension reference](./qwen-serve-protocol.md#extension-management-v2-wire-contract).

### Drive the daemon through MCP

`@qwen-code/sdk` publishes `qwen-serve-mcp`, a stdio MCP server that maps its
tools to a running daemon. Start `qwen serve`, then add this server to any MCP
client on Node.js 22 or newer:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "qwen-serve-bridge": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "-p", "@qwen-code/sdk", "qwen-serve-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "QWEN_DAEMON_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:4170",
        "QWEN_DAEMON_TOKEN": "<your-token>",
        "QWEN_WORKSPACE_CWD": "/path/to/your/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`QWEN_DAEMON_URL` defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:4170`;
`QWEN_DAEMON_TOKEN` carries the daemon bearer token when authentication is
enabled; and `QWEN_WORKSPACE_CWD` optionally supplies the default workspace for
session creation — the path must already be registered with the daemon (start
it with `--workspace <path>`), because the value is forwarded verbatim as
`POST /session`'s `cwd` and an unregistered path makes every
session-establishing tool fail with `400 workspace_mismatch`; leave it unset to
use the primary workspace. These names are read by the MCP bridge. Daemon
channel and TUI adapters instead use `QWEN_DAEMON_WORKSPACE` for their
workspace override; they also read `QWEN_DAEMON_URL` and `QWEN_DAEMON_TOKEN`.
Leave `QWEN_BRIDGE_ALLOW_GLOBAL_SCOPE` unset unless the MCP client is trusted
to perform restricted writes. Set it to `true` to enable exactly: the
`auto-edit`, `auto` and `yolo` approval modes plus any `persist: true`
approval-mode write; workspace tool toggling; MCP server restart; and
global-scope memory and agent writes. Switching between `plan` and `default`
and workspace-scope memory writes work without it. The package's
[bridge README](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/blob/main/packages/sdk-typescript/src/daemon-mcp/serve-bridge/README.md)
lists every tool and the programmatic API.

### Embed the Web Shell

Use `@qwen-code/web-shell` when your React application should own the page and
server while Qwen Code supplies the chat UI. The package is workspace-internal
for now — no release step publishes it to npm yet — so build it from the
[monorepo](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code) and depend on it by path, the
same way `packages/web-templates` consumes it:

```bash
cd qwen-code
npm ci
npm run build --workspace=@qwen-code/web-shell
```

Then in your application:

```bash
npm install @qwen-code/sdk react react-dom
npm install file:../qwen-code/packages/web-shell
```

```tsx
import { WebShellWithProviders } from '@qwen-code/web-shell';

<WebShellWithProviders
  baseUrl="https://daemon.example.com"
  token={daemonToken}
  sessionId={sessionId}
  sessionContext={{ kind: 'standalone' }}
/>;
```

This direct browser connection is suitable only for the trusted,
single-operator model described below: the `token` grants the browser full
daemon authority. When the application and daemon use different origins, start
the daemon with `--allow-origin <application-origin>`; a non-loopback origin
also requires a bearer token, and the daemon refuses to start without one —
see [Start the daemon](#start-the-daemon). The package also exports
providers for sharing one daemon session across several views and a separate
`@qwen-code/web-shell/transcript` entry point for read-only transcript
rendering. See the
[package README](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/blob/main/packages/web-shell/README.md)
for those variants and the prop contract.

## Two things to know before designing

**The daemon does not run inference in-process.** It spawns `qwen --acp` child
processes and brokers between them and HTTP. It runs the CLI entry script under
the same Node binary, using `QWEN_CLI_ENTRY` or otherwise `process.argv[1]`.
An embedding Node backend must point `QWEN_CLI_ENTRY` at the installed Qwen CLI
entry script; there is no `qwen` lookup on `PATH`. A missing entry point surfaces
as `MissingCliEntryError`.

In steady state there is **one child per active workspace runtime**, not one per
session. Every session in a workspace multiplexes onto that child and shares its
process, OAuth state, file cache and hierarchy-memory parse. So the fault domain
is the workspace: if the child exits, every session multiplexed onto it is torn
down together. Size the container for the daemon plus one child per registered
workspace, with headroom for one extra child per runtime during a channel swap.
When sessions must fail independently, run separate daemons —
`--max-sessions` caps concurrency, not blast radius.

**Authentication is single-operator.** The runtime bearer token grants the
whole bearer-gated API, and a trusted loopback caller gets full authority
including code execution as the daemon user. There is no per-end-user principal
model. If you are putting
this behind a multi-user product, your backend owns user identity and must not
hand the daemon token to browsers. Containerised and multi-tenant deployment
are explicitly deferred — see "v0.16-alpha known limits" in the
[user guide](../users/qwen-serve.md).

Configured channel webhook ingress (`POST /channels/:channelName/webhooks/:source`)
uses its own `x-qwen-webhook-secret` authentication before bearer
authentication; it is inert until a channel webhook source is configured.

## Start the daemon

Generate the token once in terminal 1. The shell builtin prints it so you can
paste the same value into the hidden prompt shown below in every other terminal:

```bash
export QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
printf 'Copy this token to the other terminals: %s\n' "$QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN"
export DAEMON_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4170
```

Terminal 1 — this command blocks, so leave it running:

```bash
qwen serve --no-web --require-auth \
  --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 4170 \
  --workspace /srv/project
```

In every other terminal, paste the token printed by terminal 1 when `read`
prompts for it. This keeps the token out of shell history and child-process
arguments:

```bash
read -rsp 'QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN: ' QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN; printf '\n'
export QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN
export DAEMON_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4170
```

`DAEMON_URL` is the loopback base URL every client command below uses — export
it, with the same value, in each terminal you run them in — and it matches
`servers[0].url` in the [OpenAPI artifact](./daemon-rest-api-reference.md). The
daemon still binds `0.0.0.0` so a remote host can reach it, but do not point
`DAEMON_URL` at that host in plaintext: a bearer token that can drive a shell is
readable by anyone on the path. Reach a non-loopback host over TLS (see below).

`--no-web` preserves the routes listed below, but disables Web Shell assets and
dependent surfaces: on macOS the `/live/*` routes and `/live/host` socket, and on
every platform `GET /mcp-app-sandbox`. Pass the token by environment rather than
`--token`, which is readable by any local user through `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`.

The Bash examples below pass the Authorization header through a file descriptor
using the shell's `printf` builtin, keeping the token out of curl's arguments.
They require Bash, curl, and jq. For cross-device access, terminate TLS as
described in [HTTPS / TLS for mobile and cross-device access](../users/qwen-serve.md#https--tls-for-mobile--cross-device-access);
the daemon then serves `https://` on the same port, so re-export `DAEMON_URL`
with the `https://` scheme before running the commands below.

## The routes an integration actually uses

Most of what the daemon registers exists to drive the Web Shell — git
operations, extension install, workspace trust, voice, scheduled tasks — and
changes with that UI. The subset below is an order of magnitude smaller.

These are the ones a REST integration needs. Treat the rest as internal.

Token usage is not part of this surface: for a top-level session,
`GET /session/:id/context` returns the live model, mode, and
configuration-option state. A `subagent.`-prefixed virtual session id resolves
against its parent runtime and returns an empty `state` object. Usage counters
sit on `GET /session/:id/context-usage`, a route this contract does not specify
— it carries the `session_context_usage` capability tag and is described only
in the internal [session lifecycle notes](./daemon/08-session-lifecycle.md#context-usage-session_context_usage-capability-tag).

## Minimal flow

**1. Preflight.** Read `workspaceCwd` (so you can omit `cwd` on create) and
`policy.permission` (so you know who may answer permission requests).

```bash
curl -sH @<(printf 'Authorization: Bearer %s\n' "$QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN") "$DAEMON_URL/capabilities"
```

**2. Create a session.** Use `sessionScope: "thread"` unless callers are meant
to share one conversation — the default `"single"` makes a second
same-workspace create _reuse_ the existing session, serialising unrelated
callers through one queue.

```bash
SESSION_JSON="$(curl -sX POST "$DAEMON_URL/session" \
  -H @<(printf 'Authorization: Bearer %s\n' "$QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN") -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"sessionScope":"thread"}')" || echo "create failed (curl exit $?)" >&2
printf '%s\n' "$SESSION_JSON"
SID="$(printf '%s' "$SESSION_JSON" | jq -er '.sessionId // empty')"
export SID
: "${SID:?no sessionId in the create response}"
# → {"sessionId":"…","workspaceCwd":"/srv/project","attached":false}
```

**3. Subscribe before prompting.** Run this in a second terminal with the same
`QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN` and `DAEMON_URL`, and with `SID` set to the `sessionId` step
2 printed: exports do not cross terminals, so re-export the token and
`DAEMON_URL` there and set `SID` to that `sessionId` yourself. Do not paste the
block back into terminal 1 — its `SID=` assignment would overwrite the value
steps 4-6 use. `Last-Event-ID: 0` replays from the oldest
retained event, which is how you catch events fired between create and
subscribe — notably `model_switch_failed`. On an **attach** (the default
`sessionScope: "single"` reusing an existing session) that event is the only
signal that a bad `modelServiceId` was rejected, because the failure is
deliberately not propagated as an HTTP error. On a **fresh create** that carries
`modelServiceId` — which step 2's body does not — the `200` body also carries
`modelApplied`, `false` when the switch was rejected, and that is the
deterministic one to act on rather than an event on a bounded ring. A create
carrying neither `modelServiceId` nor `startupConfig` has no `modelApplied` key
of its own — one that coalesced with an in-flight spawn reports the spawn
owner's `modelApplied`, which is why the attach signal to act on stays
`model_switch_failed`.

To confirm a startup selection instead of using legacy best-effort switching,
preflight `session_startup_config` and send `startupConfig: { modelServiceId,
reasoningEffort? }`. Model-only creation works without a reasoning control; an
explicit unsupported effort fails with `422 startup_config_rejected` rather than
returning `modelApplied: false`. Startup does not write shared defaults.

```bash
# terminal 2 — re-export what you need; shell variables do not cross terminals
# export QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN='<the token from step 1>'
# export DAEMON_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4170
SID='<sessionId from step 2>'
curl -N "$DAEMON_URL/session/$SID/events" \
  -H @<(printf 'Authorization: Bearer %s\n' "$QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN") \
  -H 'Accept: text/event-stream' -H 'Last-Event-ID: 0'
```

Each `data:` line is a full envelope on one line; the envelope's `type` matches
the `event:` line.

Replay is limited by `--event-ring-size` and a fixed 8 MiB per-subscription byte
budget. If the stream emits `state_resync_required` with
`reason: "replay_budget_exceeded"`, recover through `POST /session/:id/load`
instead of treating the replay as complete.

**4. Prompt.** `202` means admitted, not finished. Correlate `turn_complete` /
`turn_error` on the stream by `promptId`. Read `stopReason` on `turn_complete`;
on `turn_error`, read `message` and any optional `code` / `errorKind` — see
[`POST /session/:id/prompt`](./qwen-serve-protocol.md#post-sessionidprompt).

```bash
curl -sX POST "$DAEMON_URL/session/$SID/prompt" \
  -H @<(printf 'Authorization: Bearer %s\n' "$QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN") -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt":[{"type":"text","text":"What does src/main.ts do?"}]}'
# → 202 {"promptId":"…","lastEventId":42}
```

**5. Answer permission requests.** When the agent wants to run a tool _and its
approval mode asks for confirmation_, it emits `permission_request` and the turn
blocks until someone answers or you cancel — **by default there is no timeout**
(`--permission-response-timeout-ms` defaults to `0` = wait indefinitely), so an
unanswered request keeps holding a slot in the session's prompt queue until you
cancel or close the session. Arm your own deadline if the flow needs one.

The mode is the child's own Qwen setting `tools.approvalMode`, resolved from the
daemon host's and the `--workspace` directory's settings; the daemon pins
nothing at spawn. Its default is `auto`, which approves one class of tool calls
without asking — those publish no `permission_request` at all — and still asks
for the rest. An untrusted workspace folder is forced down to `default` (ask),
which is why one deployment sees these events and another sees none, and
`GET /capabilities` reports the vote-mediation policy rather than the approval
mode, so preflight will not tell you which posture you are in. If your
integration depends on approval gating, pin `tools.approvalMode` explicitly and
decide up front how it answers: auto-approval can already be in effect without
anyone having chosen it.

Answer on the session-scoped route: it reaches the owning workspace whenever
exactly one live runtime owns the session, and never falls back to the primary
bridge. An untrusted non-primary owner returns `403 untrusted_workspace`; the
primary runtime is exempt from this trust check, so an untrusted primary owner
may accept the vote. An unresolved owner fails closed instead of voting on the
wrong runtime — `404 session_not_found`, `500 ambiguous_session_owner`, or
`503 workspace_runtime_unavailable` with `Retry-After: 1` (retry; the vote was
not recorded). Copy `data.requestId` from the `permission_request` event and
set it before voting:

```bash
export REQUEST_ID='<data.requestId>'
curl -sX POST "$DAEMON_URL/session/$SID/permission/$REQUEST_ID" \
  -H @<(printf 'Authorization: Bearer %s\n' "$QWEN_SERVER_TOKEN") -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"outcome":{"outcome":"selected","optionId":"proceed_once"}}'
```

**6. Close.** `DELETE /session/$SID` → `204`. The on-disk session is retained.

Before rejecting, a fully managed daemon may reclaim one least-recently-used empty ACP from a different, trusted, active non-internal workspace runtime owned by the daemon, with no live sessions or pending work and retry admission once. If no other workspace qualifies (including the single-workspace case), the rejection is unchanged. Loaded sessions remain protected; workspace registration and saved history survive reclamation. `--memory-budget-mb` controls the adaptive live-journal growth pool for `POST /session/:id/load`, not SSE replay; pinning either `--max-journal-bytes` or `--max-journal-events` disables growth. Experimental opt-in `enforce` also sets each managed child's fixed old-space ceiling from the modeled budget; other modes keep legacy host-derived arguments. `limits.memory.enforced` reports that wiring, not an RSS guarantee. Calibrate the workload before enabling; restart with `admit` to roll back. See [Configuration](./daemon/17-configuration.md) for budget calculation. SSE replay is separately bounded by `--event-ring-size` and a fixed 8 MiB per-subscription budget; an omitted tail produces `state_resync_required` with `reason: "replay_budget_exceeded"` |

## Choosing a workspace when ACP capacity is exhausted

When an App first-submit session creation, an existing-session load/resume (including embedded panes), or explicit Skills runtime preparation safely returns `acp_child_capacity_exhausted`, Web Shell offers a workspace chooser if the daemon advertises `workspace_runtime_stop`. Cancel preserves the initiating draft and existing work. Selecting a workspace and confirming interrupts all previewed sessions and their tools, while retaining registration, files and saved history. Workspaces with independent services or enabled scheduled tasks are disabled with a reason. New-session creation by an embedding host remains the host's responsibility; an empty ChatPane does not lazily create a session through sendPrompt. No additional environment variables are needed, and automatic reclamation still only selects empty runtimes.

API clients can read `GET /workspaces/runtime-stop-options`, obtain user confirmation, and submit the exact channel/epoch/token/session set to `POST /workspaces/:workspace/runtime/stop`. Treat unknown or partial outcomes as such: refresh the selected receipt, do not assume a lost response means nothing stopped, and do not blindly retry the original prompt. Continue the original operation once only after `stopped` and `released` are true and its daemon, workspace and draft remain current. A stop whose budget expires while a session close is in flight returns a failed receipt while cleanup continues; unconfirmed release then keeps the workspace isolated and its capacity counted, so refresh the matching receipt to observe later cleanup without another stop POST. A refreshed receipt reporting `stopped`/`released` may still carry the earlier teardown warning in `error` — treat `released: true` as the release signal. A stop whose budget is exhausted between session closes instead returns 409 `workspace_runtime_stop_incomplete` with cleanup already ended — the workspace is no longer isolated, that receipt will not change, and stopping the remaining sessions requires a fresh preview and confirmation. See the [runtime-stop protocol](./qwen-serve-protocol.md) for request fields, error codes and receipt semantics.
