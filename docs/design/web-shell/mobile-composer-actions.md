# Mobile composer actions

[English](mobile-composer-actions.md) | [简体中文](mobile-composer-actions.zh-CN.md)

## Problem and scope

The touch composer exposes a grid of up to 18 actions and six keyboard keys.
Several actions duplicate navigation and settings; Tab does nothing on the
textarea backend. The stop button disappears when a running session has a
draft. Small controls and horizontal add-menu submenus make phone use harder.

This change is confined to Web Shell UI. Desktop editing, daemon routes,
permissions, attachment limits, and host toolbar opt-ins retain their existing
contracts. Mobile means the existing touch textarea backend, including its URL
override; narrow desktop windows keep desktop editing.

## Design

### Toolbar and editing

Remove the legacy touch action grid and simulated Tab/Esc/left/right keys. Keep add,
model, approval, dictation, and send controls. Hide the width toggle on touch;
retain the context-usage control when enabled by the host. Put workspace
selection and Git controls
in a separate context row so starting a task in a particular workspace or
branch remains possible. The row's measured height, two lines when it wraps,
is added to the composer's height cap, so it does not come out of the
attachments' room when a soft keyboard shrinks the viewport. The rows stack
without overlapping touch targets.
Preserve host-provided toolbar slots.

Use 44px touch targets and wrap controls on very narrow viewports rather than
clip them. Keep Plan as an active-state chip. While a turn runs, stop remains
available alongside send when there is a draft; stopping never clears that
draft. Voice capture retains its existing reduced toolbar and hides the context and
editing rows.

Add a small editing row with previous/next input history on the left, expand,
and, while the textarea is focused, hide keyboard. The history arrows call the
existing navigation actions directly: up recalls older inputs, down recalls
newer inputs and then restores the draft saved before browsing. They never
submit. History search in Add remains available for finding a specific input.
The row wraps on extra-narrow screens and its history controls are disabled with the
composer. Hide keyboard blurs without returning focus through the composer
surface click handler. A modal expanded editor edits the same controlled draft,
preserves its selection when returning, and does not submit when closed. Its
Done and keyboard controls are touch sized. Shell mode gets an explicit exit
action. Session/workspace changes and disabled state close expanded editing.

### Touch add menu

Keep the existing desktop dropdown. On touch, use the shared portal-aware
bottom Drawer with one visible page at a time, a Back button, and a Close
button. Reuse provider searches, availability checks, attachment destinations,
skill prefix insertion, and session/workspace invalidation.

Offer photos, camera, message files, and upload to workspace as explicit
actions. Photos use an image-only file picker; camera requests rear capture.
Native file-picker cancellation preserves the draft. Browser/device support
determines how the native picker presents capture.

File references, extensions, MCP server references, and skills have dedicated
pages with scrolling. Reference search remains workspace-wide. Plan stays a
checked row. Add input history and a searchable command page: choosing a
command prefixes its invocation to the existing draft for review, and never
automatically runs it. This keeps Shell, Goal, and infrequent session commands
available without independent shortcuts or draft replacement. A labelled Live
voice entry moves into the drawer, with an active-call indicator retained in
the toolbar.

## Implementation and constraints

Changes affect ChatEditor, AddMenu, their CSS and tests, Git popover sizing,
the shared paste handler, LiveVoiceButton, and English/Chinese strings.
Reuse the existing Dialog and Drawer primitives and
Web Shell portal root. No new dependency or public customization API is needed.
The add control remains host opt-in. A host that explicitly enables a command
button retains a reachable command picker on mobile outside Shell mode.
Hosts without Add retain Shell and history-search buttons in the editing row;
this fallback does not enable file ingestion or references.

The history search must have a visible close action and remain touch usable.
It opens upward from the composer, so its height is also capped by the room
between the composer and the top of the visible chat area. When even its
minimum height does not fit, it overlaps the top of the composer instead of
going under the header, so its search field and close action stay on screen
with a soft keyboard open. The same positioning applies to desktop history
search: when a short window leaves insufficient room above the composer,
the panel overlaps its top so the search field stays visible. Desktop editing
and keyboard shortcuts retain their existing behavior.
The bound is the top of the lowest ancestor that
clips overflow. A host whose own header overlays the shell without clipping
it must declare `--web-shell-popover-safe-top`; that variable is also how a
host opts out of the default clearance, and a declared `0px` is honoured
rather than swallowed.
File selection must stay in a user gesture, and deferred insertions must run
after the drawer releases focus. Expanded editing must preserve attachment
and reference state in the shared composer, including IME input. Image/file
paste uses the existing ingestion lane; long-text paste uses the active
editor's selection when deciding whether to fold it into an attachment.
All imperative text insertion and focus target the expanded textarea while it
is mounted. The dialog retains the input placeholder and mobile text settings,
shows the shared attachment/image count, and returns focus without stealing it
from a newly opened approval dialog. Closing idle Live voice returns to Add.

The command page uses shared completion labels, sections, priority, hints and
subcommand results (up to 50 matches), normalizes a leading slash and surrounding
whitespace, and retains description search as a fallback. Search stays visible
while scrolling. Commands and skills are unavailable in Shell mode. Skills only
announce an empty catalog after loading has completed.

## Validation and acceptance

Use the global qwen CLI for a baseline attempt and the repository browser
harness for deterministic UI coverage. Verify local bundled UI when available.
Record any runtime limitations separately from mocked browser results.

- At phone widths, the old action grid and simulated keyboard keys are absent;
  labelled history arrows remain in the editing row. Toolbar
  actions are reachable with no horizontal overflow. Desktop toolbar behavior
  remains.
- Desktop Ctrl+R keeps the search field visible and focused in a short window
  (1280x300), overlapping the composer when necessary. Escape preserves the
  draft and returns focus to the editor. With enough room, the panel remains
  above the composer.
- With a soft keyboard open at a Pixel 7 keyboard height (about 412x450),
  attachments stay reachable beside the context row, and the history search
  field and close action stay reachable below the header. Below roughly 430px
  of viewport height the composer is already at its cap, so the attachments
  strip shrinks toward a sliver.
- Stop works with a pending draft and keeps the draft; send still queues it.
- Hide keyboard blurs the editor; expand/edit/Done preserves text, selection,
  attachments, and references. Switching sessions cannot leak expanded drafts.
- Drawer pages support tap/back/close; native photos/camera/files choose the
  correct destination; cancel leaves text intact. Provider errors and disabled
  actions remain honest, and Plan toggles exactly once.
- Commands and skills preserve existing drafts and tags; history can be opened,
  selected, or dismissed. Live voice remains accessible.
- History arrows recall older/newer inputs and restore a multiline draft
  without submitting. Empty history is inert, and both arrows remain reachable
  with 44px targets at 390px and 240px widths.
- Run focused unit/browser tests, build, typecheck, bundle, and two clean
  self-audit passes plus independent review.

## Open questions

None for implementation. Real-device iOS/Android keyboard and camera behavior
must be distinguished from browser emulation in the verification report.
