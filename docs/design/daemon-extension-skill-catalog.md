# Daemon extension Skill catalog

[English](daemon-extension-skill-catalog.md) | [简体中文](daemon-extension-skill-catalog.zh-CN.md)

This implements stage 2 of #11274. Previously the daemon-local workspace Skill
provider supplied an empty active-extension list, so its first response omitted
installed extension Skills when no child snapshot existed.

Use an unbound `ExtensionManager` for the selected workspace to load installed
extensions through the existing consistent store reader. Supply active
extensions to `SkillManager`, preserving project > user > extension > bundled
precedence. Append inactive extension Skills as management entries with the
existing `inactive_extension` status, retaining their identity and metadata.
Resolve settings and extension Skill defaults/overrides with the existing
parsers. A settings opt-in does not enable an inactive parent extension.
Resolve each extension's Skill defaults from its own manifest, with workspace
Skill overrides from the same consistent store snapshot used to load it. Cache
those booleans by the loaded extension object and normalized Skill name. This
avoids selecting the wrong owner through a colliding ID; it does not create a
new identity namespace or change store policy. Explicit opt-ins and hard
settings disablements retain their existing precedence.
Resolve localized extension names with the existing language setting and locale
helpers on every response, without changing the daemon process language or
rebuilding the directory cache when only the language changes.

Keep the lightweight Config surface: do not construct a runtime Config, start a
child, initialize MCP, execute hooks, or install watchers. Honor safe mode,
disabled discovery levels and workspace trust; inert untrusted inventory must
not load workspace settings or extension runtime context. Directory failures
continue to return an uninitialized error status.

The implementation and collocated regressions live in the daemon-local provider.
Tests cover real manifests, active/inactive state, source collisions, persisted
Skill settings, safe/untrusted contexts and explicit cache invalidation. E2E
evidence uses an isolated home and a daemon with no child session.

The facade still prefers child snapshots in this stage. Replacing that source,
changing toggle/refresh semantics, adding configured-state fields and changing
Web Shell projections belong to later PRs. No public schema changes are needed.

Discovery-level disabling suppresses active extension Skills through
`SkillManager`; inactive extension management entries are still appended, as in
the child producer. Safe mode and untrusted contexts never load extensions.

An absent extensions root is an empty inventory; no extension store is created.
With a present root the read reconciles through the shared store: a missing or
drifted store is initialized in place under the store's exclusive lock,
rewriting `extension-store/state.json`, creating its `state.previous.json`
rollback copy, and rewriting the legacy `extension-enablement.json` projection.
Cache hits reuse the loaded managers. A later rebuild still takes the lock and
may perform directory/permission maintenance even if policy is unchanged.
Unreadable roots and errors propagated by the shared store/loader return
`initialized: false` with explicit errors. That failure is deliberately
all-or-nothing: one bad extension
artifact (for example a dangling directory entry) fails the entire catalog,
project, user and bundled Skills included, until the artifact is repaired.
Individual artifact handling remains owned by the shared loader: malformed
manifests are skipped with its diagnostic, whereas a dangling extension entry
propagates an error. This stage does not add per-artifact diagnostics or
per-level degradation to the response, or change the loader's failure policy.
Existing facade caching, source preference and invalidation behavior remain
unchanged; the tracking issue assigns cache lifecycle and concurrency changes
to stage 4.

**Known later-stage items (recorded during review, deliberately not in this
stage):**

- The sibling `/workspace/extensions` route resolves its locale through
  `loadSettings` without `skipLoadEnvironment`, so a workspace `.env`
  `QWEN_CODE_LANG` can diverge from this provider's language resolution.
- The inactive-entry append and sort assembly duplicates the child producer's
  (`acpAgent.ts`). Here a per-extension name set removes duplicate inactive
  Skill names; it provides the same source separation without that string key.
- Extension mutations do not invalidate the config-catalog providers this stage
  populates, so a committed install, update, enable/disable or uninstall can
  leave stale extension Skill state on the skills config routes until an
  unrelated skill mutation, a workspace removal, or a restart. The
  invalidation wiring and `refreshCacheIfSourcesChanged` revalidation belong
  to stage 4.
- The active-Skill `enabled` judgment mirrors `Config.isSkillEnabled` by hand.
- Shared store/API handling of duplicate extension IDs remains separate. This
  provider preserves per-manifest defaults instead of querying an ambiguous
  ID for its owner; it still consumes workspace overrides by the store's ID key.
