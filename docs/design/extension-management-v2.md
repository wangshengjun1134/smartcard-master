# Extension Management V2

## Status

This design extends daemon protocol `v1` under the additive
`extension_management_v2` capability. The already-published
`workspace_extensions` capability and `/workspace/extensions/*` routes remain
available as a primary-workspace compatibility adapter.

## Resource model

An installed extension is one user-level artifact in `QWEN_HOME/extensions`.
Activation is policy, not a second copy of that artifact:

1. An exact workspace override (`enabled` or `disabled`).
2. An internal exact `inherit` mask created while migrating legacy path rules.
3. An ordered V1 path rule.
4. The global default.

Workspace identity uses the daemon's canonical workspace path. A workspace
route selects an existing runtime by workspace id first and canonical cwd
second. Reads are allowed for untrusted runtimes; activation changes, refresh,
and workspace-scoped install require a trusted target. Global mutation uses the
normal daemon mutation authentication and install consent, not the trust state
of whichever workspace initiated the request.

## Store and transaction boundary

`ExtensionStore` is the only writer of final extension directories and V2
activation state. `ExtensionManager` remains the workspace-facing facade, but
CLI, TUI, auto-update, daemon, and SDK-backed operations delegate mutations to
the store.

The layout is:

```text
~/.qwen/
├── extensions/
└── extension-store/
    ├── lock
    ├── state.json
    ├── state.previous.json
    ├── staging/
    ├── rollback/          <transaction>/ and, mid copy swap, <transaction>.partial
    └── transactions/
```

The store and artifacts share a filesystem so artifact swaps are directory
renames. On Windows a rename can be refused because a process holds a handle
inside the artifact; the transaction then switches to a copy swap recorded as
`swapStrategy: 'copy'` in its journal, which is not atomic - see
[extension-store-windows-directory-lock.md](extension-store-windows-directory-lock.md).
An in-process mutex and a `proper-lockfile` lock serialize commits
across all V2-aware processes. Every mutation re-reads state while holding the
lock and increments a monotonic generation, preventing lost updates.

Install/update preparation happens outside the final artifact directory. The
commit writes a `prepared` journal, moves the old artifact to rollback (or copies
it, in a copy swap), moves staging into place - copied over the installed tree
there - and atomically writes `state.json`. That state rename is the
commit point. Before it, recovery rolls back; after it, recovery only completes
projection and cleanup. A committed policy is never rolled back because one
runtime refresh failed. If both a pre-commit operation and its rollback fail, the
caller receives both errors and the journal remains; a lock-defeated rollback is
retried on a later operation instead of stopping every one - once a deferred
retry window has elapsed, and only while a retry can still leave a loadable
artifact behind; a rollback that could not is refused rather than retried, so
reads never report an installed extension with no artifact.

Store files use owner-only permissions and atomic no-follow writes. Extension
ids, direct-child artifact paths, transaction paths, and names are validated.
Failures are reported with credential-redacted sources.

## V1 migration and downgrade projection

The first V2-aware process imports ordered rules from
`extension-enablement.json` without materializing the current set of registered
workspaces as exact overrides. V2 writes a compatible projection after each
state commit and stores its hash in `state.json`.

If hashes differ, modification order decides the recovery direction: an older
projection is repaired from authoritative V2 state; a projection modified after
V2 state is treated as a sequential write by a downgraded binary and is
re-imported with a new generation. Concurrent V1 and V2 writers sharing one
`QWEN_HOME` are intentionally unsupported.

Clearing a public workspace override normally deletes the exact record. If an
older path rule would then change the effective value, the store writes an
internal `inherit` mask so DELETE still means “inherit the global default.”

## Daemon API

The global surface is:

```text
GET    /extensions
PUT    /extensions/activation
POST   /extensions/install
POST   /extensions/check-updates
POST   /extensions/:extensionId/update
DELETE /extensions/:extensionId
PUT    /extensions/:extensionId/activation
GET    /extensions/operations/:operationId
```

Install requires explicit consent and initial activation:

```ts
type InitialActivation =
  | { scope: 'user' }
  | { scope: 'workspace'; workspaceId: string };
```

The daemon install endpoint accepts HTTPS Git, GitHub Release, npm, and
absolute-path local sources. SSH and link sources remain local CLI features.
Update preserves the extension id,
manifest name, settings, and activation policy. “Already current” is a
successful `updated: false` result. Uninstall is idempotent and removes both the
artifact and policy.

The workspace projection is:

```text
GET    /workspaces/:workspace/extensions
PUT    /workspaces/:workspace/extensions/activation
PUT    /workspaces/:workspace/extensions/:extensionId/activation
DELETE /workspaces/:workspace/extensions/:extensionId/activation
POST   /workspaces/:workspace/extensions/refresh
```

It intentionally has no workspace artifact mutation routes. Projection entries
include default, exact workspace value, effective value, and source. Desired
generation and locally applied generation are top-level response fields.

Potentially slow mutations return `202`, `Location`, and `Retry-After`. The
operation record is daemon-local memory, retains at most 100 terminal records,
and can disappear on restart. Catalog/store recovery is authoritative. SDK
polling timeout stops polling only; it never cancels accepted work.

The daemon admits at most 10 unfinished extension operations. A daemon-wide
FIFO preparation queue runs at most two downloads, extractions, conversions,
or single-extension update checks at once. Install and update use an explicit
`prepare -> commit/dispose` lifecycle: preparation owns staging files and
revisioned credential snapshots but does not change the store, cache, runtime,
or credentials selected by the installed artifact. Prepared mutations enter a
separate single-concurrency FIFO commit queue in the order preparation
finishes. Activation and uninstall enter only the commit queue; check-updates
enters only the preparation queue. Activation operations finish at the durable
commit point and do not directly refresh active sessions. Manual refresh is
serialized through the commit queue. Its HTTP timeout releases that lane so a
stalled runtime refresh cannot permanently block later extension mutations; the
already-started refresh may still settle afterward. Sensitive settings are
staged as one atomic secret bundle under a per-prepare revision. A non-secret
selector records that revision and secure-storage backend inside the staged
artifact, so only the winning artifact commit activates a complete bundle. The
store commit is therefore the
durability point and releases the commit lane immediately. Extension reload,
legacy per-key settings synchronization, manager runtime refresh, prepared-file
cleanup, and daemon runtime reconciliation run outside it. These post-commit
steps do not occupy either slot, so later commits may proceed while an earlier
generation is being applied or cleaned up.

Disposing a prepared mutation removes its unselected credential snapshot, and a
successful commit removes the previously selected snapshot best-effort. A hard
process crash before disposal can leave an unreachable entry in the secure
backend; no artifact selector references it, so it cannot become active or be
mistaken for the committed credentials.

The preparation deadline starts when an operation first acquires a preparation
slot, not while it waits. Abort is propagated to network operations and active
archive scanning and extraction streams. A started task continues to occupy its
slot until its underlying promise settles even if it ignores abort. Commit is
not cancellable. Prepared updates carry the target artifact generation:
unrelated extension or activation changes safely rebase, while a stale update
of the same artifact fails with `extension_conflict`.

Remote npm metadata is streamed with a 10 MiB response cap. npm and GitHub
archives have separate 100 MiB download caps, request deadlines, redirect
limits, and archive-entry validation before extraction.

## Runtime reconciliation

A successful artifact commit invalidates local status and refreshes affected
runtimes. Activation commits only persist policy; clients that need immediate
application submit the independent runtime-refresh operation. Global artifact
changes reconcile all runtimes in this daemon. Runtime reconciliation refreshes
extension and skill caches, extension tools, hierarchical memory, active chat
system instructions, and available commands. A failed component does not skip
the remaining refresh components; the session RPC reports the combined failure
after all components have been attempted. Runtime generation reconciliation
uses a daemon-wide FIFO shared by mutations and the generation poller. A
mutation reserves its position at the durable commit callback, so later
generations cannot refresh a runtime first even when earlier post-commit work
finishes later.
The ACP bridge bounds each session refresh at 30 seconds. If the aggregate
refresh still exceeds the route deadline, the controller releases the commit
lane without cancelling the underlying RPC. Applying generation N also
satisfies waiters for older generations,
and a late lower-generation refresh therefore cannot move the applied
generation backwards. Partial refresh failure or post-commit reload/cleanup
failure produces `succeeded_with_warnings` with workspace-specific or commit
diagnostics, without rolling back the artifact.

Legacy workspace migration treats a committed artifact as failed only when it
could not be reloaded. Settings compatibility synchronization, cleanup, or
runtime-refresh warnings do not trigger a retry of an artifact that is already
durably installed. Update callers receive warning details; compatibility and
cleanup warnings use a distinct `updated with warnings` state, while reload or
runtime-refresh failures remain `updated, needs restart`.

The extension file watcher observes only `extension-store/state.json` for
policy generation and continues to observe installed/linked extension content
for command, skill, agent, hook, and MCP changes. A 30-second generation poll
repairs missed filesystem events and bounds convergence for other daemons that
share the store.

## Compatibility

`workspace_extensions` remains the capability for the existing singular
surface. Its handlers call the same manager/coordinator and adapt responses:
project activation becomes a primary workspace override; user activation keeps
the legacy rule-clearing behavior. Activation through either surface is
commit-only when `extension_activation_explicit_refresh` is advertised. The
legacy operation endpoint maps V2 warning completion back to the published
legacy refresh-error status.

Clients must check `extension_management_v2`; neither daemon mode nor another
workspace capability implies this API. Batch activation additionally requires
`extension_batch_activation_v2`, because older V2 daemons expose only singular
activation routes. Clients that require activation changes to apply to active
sessions must check `extension_activation_explicit_refresh`: when present, wait
for the activation operation to commit and then submit the independent refresh
operation; older daemons already refresh within the activation operation. The
abandoned `workspace_qualified_extensions` proposal is not part of the protocol.

## Non-goals

- Per-workspace artifact copies.
- A daemon registry or remote acknowledgement protocol.
- User cancellation of accepted operations.
- Concurrent old-binary and V2-aware writes to one `QWEN_HOME`.
- Removing the V1 adapter before a future protocol-v2 migration.
