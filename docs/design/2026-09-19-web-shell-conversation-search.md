# Search within a Web Shell conversation

## Problem and scope

Issue #12231 requests a search dialog beside the scroll-to-bottom button, with direct navigation to matching content. The sidebar search from #10261 / #10612 finds sessions and returns one snippet per session; it cannot locate individual messages. #6824 and #11111 concern other session-search surfaces. This change searches user and assistant text, including Markdown and code, in the active Web Shell conversation. It does not change cross-session search, tools, thinking, or model requests.

## Design

Expose `conversationSearchThreshold` on `WebShellProps`, defaulting to 10. The search icon appears when the user/assistant message count strictly exceeds this threshold, independently of whether the scroll-to-bottom button is visible. Position a compact 14px search icon below the left session timeline, with a 20px-wide button that fits the navigation gutter. The search entry is hidden whenever the timeline ticks are hidden. Embedding entry points inherit the option.

Reuse `DialogShell`, localized labels, semantic colors, and the portal root. Focus the input on opening. Debounce text queries, show highlighted snippets, support result selection and previous/next result controls, and close with Escape. Keep the composer draft and running response untouched. Search-only translations stay with the interactive component so the read-only HTML export does not bundle them.

Use the session-owned turn-navigation client to scan persisted transcript pages into isolated per-page projections. Obtain a snapshot from the head index before requesting an explicit start offset; all subsequent index pages use that frozen snapshot. Retain at most 200 result snippets rather than loading the whole transcript into the live store. Display the available result count and whether results were capped. An empty query with `stopAfterMessages` probes the visibility threshold without scanning the entire history. Matching is literal and case-insensitive, including Chinese text.

Results carry persisted record identity and the containing turn ordinal from the turn index. Render-time message IDs are not stable across projections. Navigation reuses the existing historical viewport: locate the turn, page forward if needed, map the persisted record to the current block/message, expand folded content, center it, and flash the target. Historical pages remain subject to the existing LRU budget. Live messages are searched from the current transcript snapshot and merged with persisted hits by source identity.

## Lifecycle and limitations

Closing the dialog, changing the query, or switching sessions invalidates outstanding searches. Navigation rejects stale session/revision results and verifies the persisted turn identity. Partial replay and request failures must remain visible with retry; they must not be reported as a completed search with no matches. Older daemons without turn navigation can search loaded messages, with an explicit limited-history notice. No additional daemon API, full-text index, or settings persistence is introduced.

## Files and validation

The implementation belongs to the Web Shell entry props, search component, i18n, turn-navigation store, historical viewport hook/handle, README, and collocated tests. Use synthetic transcripts only.

Verify the 10/11 boundary and custom thresholds; old messages outside the live window; user/assistant/code and Chinese/English text; repeated matching messages; empty/no-match queries; stale requests and session changes; collapsed and virtualized targets; draft preservation; and streaming continuity. Check light/dark, Chinese/English, desktop/mobile, and portal behavior. Record baseline and local-build E2E evidence separately from unit/build/typecheck results.

## Open questions

None. The threshold is a host component option; a settings-page control and cross-session search are outside this issue.

## Public host navigation

`WebShellApi.navigateToMessage({ sessionId, recordId, signal? })` is available through `shellRef` on both embedding components. Request/result types are exported from the package root. The host selects the session/workspace through the existing provider lifecycle first. This API never switches sessions or sends prompts; it can run with the timeline hidden or the search threshold unmet.

`recordId` is the stable persisted transcript identity, not a rendered block ID, timestamp, or snippet. Resolution scans a frozen historical snapshot until that exact user/assistant record is found, retaining only one hit. Navigation then reuses the bounded historical viewport and highlights the projected message. Duplicate text cannot redirect the operation to a different record. Very old targets require linear transcript reads; no server-side record index is introduced.

The promise returns a `status`: `located` (the navigation target is activated; scrolling/highlighting occurs on the subsequent React render, not an animation-completion signal), `not_found` (absent persisted user/assistant record), `not_ready` (session/history/viewport not ready), `session_mismatch`, `unsupported` (legacy history), `cancelled`, or `error` (read/navigation failure). Host callers should react to readiness instead of treating `not_ready` as an empty result. `AbortSignal`, an accepted newer host request, session/workspace changes, transcript revision changes, and unmounting invalidate pending work. Rejected calls (stale API owners, already-aborted signals, mismatched sessions, or empty record IDs) do not supersede an active navigation.

Cross-session search still returns a session and one snippet, without record IDs. A host must retain the persisted record ID in its search results before using exact navigation. Extending that search endpoint, archive search, and downstream host UI are separate work; this API does not imply those capabilities exist.

## Review fixes: dialog lifetime and exact navigation

The search state and dialog stay mounted above the transcript viewport. Only the trigger moves between the global and in-list timelines; switching navigation modes or hiding the timeline preserves an open query. Closing restores focus to the current trigger, or the composer when that trigger is unavailable. Session identity still resets the search state.

A persisted user record can resolve through its verified live prompt alias. Assistant records must resolve to their own block, loading retained history even when the user turn is live. Search navigation waits for an existing boundary read and can retry a retryable boundary failure; it never substitutes the user turn for an assistant record.

IME confirmation keys do not select a result. Incomplete scans cannot replace an established visibility count, and reconnecting retries the count probe and active query. A search keeps the currently viewed historical page pinned until it succeeds, so cancellation or failure cannot evict the page being read.

Progressive history results preserve selection by message identity rather than list position. Incomplete scans expose the same retry action as failed scans. The search input and results use combobox/listbox semantics so the active option is available to assistive technology.
