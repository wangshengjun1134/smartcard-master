# DingTalk dynamic lifecycle tags

## Goal

Expose agent progress consistently on both the inbound DingTalk message and the interactive response card without changing the card template or exposing raw tool input, output, or reasoning.

## Lifecycle

- Start with two tags: `👀` and `🤔 Thinking`.
- Keep `👀` fixed while replacing only the status tag.
- Map tool events to the phases in the projection contract table below (`📖 Reading`, `🔎 Searching`, `🖥️ Running`, `🛠️ Editing`, `🗑️ Deleting`, `📦 Moving`, `🤔 Thinking`, `🌐 Fetching`, `🔄 Switching mode`, `🛠️ Working`, or `⚠️ Tool failed`).
- Map response text to `✍️ Replying`.
- On a terminal event, recall both transient tags before adding exactly one of `✅ Done`, `❌ Failed`, or `⏹️ Stopped`.

Reaction operations for one inbound message use a desired-state drain. A newer phase overwrites any pending phase, and a terminal event preempts every phase that has not reached DingTalk yet. An already in-flight API request cannot be cancelled, so the drain re-reads desired state after each response and removes any obsolete tag before settling. If a status recall fails, the replacement is skipped to avoid stacking contradictory statuses.

The same lifecycle mapping drives a replaceable first line in the interactive response card body. A newly created card starts at `🤔 Thinking`; tool activity replaces that line with the mapped phase before any response text exists, and the first response chunk changes it to `✍️ Replying`. While a response streams, its content appears below that phase line. Duplicate phase events are coalesced.

## ACP tool-kind projection contract

| ACP kind           | Phase       | English             | Chinese         |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| `read`             | `reading`   | `📖 Reading`        | `📖 读取中`     |
| `edit`             | `editing`   | `🛠️ Editing`        | `🛠️ 编辑中`     |
| `delete`           | `deleting`  | `🗑️ Deleting`       | `🗑️ 删除中`     |
| `move`             | `moving`    | `📦 Moving`         | `📦 移动中`     |
| `search`           | `searching` | `🔎 Searching`      | `🔎 搜索中`     |
| `execute`          | `running`   | `🖥️ Running`        | `🖥️ 执行中`     |
| `think`            | `thinking`  | `🤔 Thinking`       | `🤔 思考中`     |
| `fetch`            | `fetching`  | `🌐 Fetching`       | `🌐 获取中`     |
| `switch_mode`      | `switching` | `🔄 Switching mode` | `🔄 切换模式中` |
| `other` or unknown | `working`   | `🛠️ Working`        | `🛠️ 处理中`     |

The projection first exactly matches standard ACP kinds, then uses legacy and third-party Bridge aliases. `other` remains the final fallback. Reactions and active card bodies use the same localized phase label. Distinguishing ACP `Agent` from `Other` requires new protocol metadata; the current protocol normalizes both to `other`.

The running card displays only the allowlisted phase label. ACP tool titles are not projected because built-in tools may derive them from commands, paths, or parameters. Reactions remain phase-only. The local bridge retains the safe tool kind from the initial event so kindless terminal updates can drive `Tool failed` or return to `Thinking`; meta-only shell-progress heartbeats remain ignored and do not create another response boundary.

The running card's `statusLine` contains only the configured model and elapsed time. On completion, the process line is removed from the body so only the final assistant response remains; the existing terminal state, model, and elapsed time stay in `statusLine`. Tool descriptions, paths, commands, parameters, raw input, raw output, and model reasoning are never added to card content.

Phase and terminal labels use the effective Qwen display language after environment override, configured-language selection, and `auto` system-language detection. Presentation language never changes the agent prompt or tool-call schema.

When named-task attribution supplies a source label, the phase remains the first running-state line and the escaped source label stays above the response content throughout running, streaming, fallback, and terminal card states.

## Delivery modes

Lifecycle presentation is driven by channel lifecycle events, independently of response delivery. Plain replies, interactive status cards, and block-streaming cards therefore share the same inbound-message tag behavior. Interactive cards also project the current phase into the body; block streaming does not create a status card and continues to rely on the inbound-message tags for progress.

Reaction failures and status-card metadata failures are isolated from each other and from response delivery.

## Cleanup

Prompt cleanup, session death, adapter disconnect, and standalone ACP bridge process exit recall both transient tags without adding a terminal result when the real outcome is unknown. A bridge process exit also terminalizes the running status card as interrupted; crash recovery restores the sessions on a fresh bridge, so session routing state is left untouched.
