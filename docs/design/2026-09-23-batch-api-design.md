# `/batch-api` design

[中文版](./2026-09-23-batch-api-design.zh-CN.md)

Status: implemented in PR #12492. User guide: `docs/users/features/batch.md`.
Measured data: `docs/verification/batch-api/results-2026-09-23.md`.

## 1. Goal

The user states a bulk task in one sentence, explicitly picks the
asynchronous Batch mode, and later receives delivered files.

- The agent does only the semantic work: judge suitability, sample 2–3 files,
  write the shared rules, write a plan file.
- The Batch API does the bulk generation.
- Deterministic code owns submission, recovery, validation, delivery and
  accounting.

In scope: many **independent, single-turn** transforms whose materials exist
now (translate a set of documents under one style guide, rewrite or extract
per file). Out of scope: tasks that need feedback, chained items, a handful
of items.

## 2. Entry points

### 2.1 `/batch-api <task>` (interactive skill)

- `packages/core/src/skills/bundled/batch-api/SKILL.md`, next to — not a
  replacement for — the realtime parallel `/batch`.
- `disable-model-invocation: true`: only the user can enter the Batch path.
  `/batch`'s description lets the model _suggest_ typing `/batch-api`.
- `allowedTools` pre-approves read-only tools (`glob`, `grep_search`,
  `read_file`); writing the plan and `qwen batch run` (which spends money)
  stay behind the approval prompt.
- Flow:
  1. `qwen batch --help` confirms the CLI has these subcommands (an older CLI
     would treat `batch check` as a billed prompt); then `qwen batch check`
     verifies credentials, endpoint and the Batch route
     and shows the settings a run would freeze. Nothing is billed; on
     failure, stop before spending anything on preparation.
  2. Judge suitability. Unsuitable → explain and stop; **never silently do
     the work realtime**.
  3. Prepare lightly: glob the files, read a 2–3 file sample, write the
     shared rules once.
  4. Write the plan to `.qwen/batch/plans/<slug>.json`.
  5. Preview with `qwen batch run <plan> --dry-run` (nothing uploaded) and
     show the user the item count, frozen settings and estimate; then submit
     that exact snapshot with `qwen batch run <plan> --expect <digest>`.
     Approving this command is the spending decision, made with the preview
     in view; a batch that changed since the preview is refused.
  6. Start `qwen batch collect <task-id> --wait` as a background shell and
     end the turn (§6).
  7. When the waiter exits, the agent is notified once: it reports the
     summary and does only the follow-up the user asked for. It never
     retries (a retry bills again) and never redoes an item itself.
- Every command runs as `"${QWEN_CODE_CLI:-qwen}" batch …`, so it reaches the
  CLI running the session.

### 2.2 `qwen batch` subcommands (deterministic executor)

| Command             | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `check`             | Verify credentials, endpoint and Batch route; show what `run` would freeze; nothing billed                                                                                        |
| `run <plan>`        | Validate plan → assemble → estimate → budget gate → submit → record; `--dry-run` stops before upload and prints a snapshot digest, `--expect <digest>` submits only that snapshot |
| `collect <task-id>` | Reconcile → poll (optional `--wait`) → download → validate → deliver → report                                                                                                     |
| `retry <task-id>`   | Resubmit only `failed` items as a new attempt; truncated ones need `--max-output-tokens`                                                                                          |
| `list`              | List recorded tasks (local only, no credentials)                                                                                                                                  |
| `cancel <task-id>`  | Cancel the task's active batch (finished requests are still billed)                                                                                                               |
| `clean <task-id>`   | Delete the local record; cancels nothing; refuses while a batch may be open unless forced                                                                                         |

`run` prints the task id and exits, so waiting never costs agent turns.
`collect` can run any number of times.

There are no raw `submit` / `status` / `fetch` verbs: anything outside the
document-transform contract belongs to a new plan kind, not a side channel.

## 3. Architecture

```text
user: /batch-api "translate docs/zh into docs/en"
        │
        ▼
prepare skill (batch-api/SKILL.md): semantic work only, runs realtime
        │  plan JSON (§4)
        ▼
executor batch-workflow.ts: run / collect / retry / cancel / clean / check / list
  ├─ batch-task.ts    ledger: task / item / attempt records, atomic writes, per-task lock
  ├─ batch-docs.ts    assemble requests, validate results, deliver files
  └─ batch-client.ts  HTTP primitives; errors carry the HTTP status
        │
        ▼
batch.ts: endpoint / auth resolution, CLI registration

interactive session: batch-auto-collect.ts (started by startPostRenderPrefetches)
  → runs the same collectTask for this project's open tasks
```

### Invariants

- **The ledger answers "which remote objects might exist?" without
  guessing.** Intent is persisted before upload, the uploaded file id before
  create. A lost create answer — or a process that died mid-create — marks
  the attempt `submit-unknown`; `collect` reconciles it against the
  provider's batch list by `input_file_id` and **never resubmits blindly**,
  because a wrong answer bills twice.
- **Records live with the user, not the repository.** Tasks are kept under
  `~/.qwen/batch` (`QWEN_BATCH_HOME` overrides) with 0700/0600 permissions,
  record their project root, and work from any directory. Only the agent's
  plan files stay in the project, git-ignored.
- **A task is pinned to its endpoint.** `run` freezes the base URL and a
  short hash of the API key (never the key); `collect` / `retry` / `cancel`
  refuse under different settings, since the batch is invisible from another
  account or region.
- **One command per task at a time.** A per-task lock file records pid and
  host. It is taken over only when its release is certain: written on this
  host by a pid that no longer exists. A lock from another host is never
  taken over. Stale recovery is serialized by an exclusive `lock.recover`
  guard and rechecks the owner before removal. If recovery itself crashes,
  the next stale recovery fails closed; the error names both files to remove
  after confirming no command is running.
- **custom_id = `<itemId>#<attempt>`**, so results map back across retries.
  Each item records the attempt that owns it, and only that attempt's result
  lines may change it: an older attempt's failure never re-opens the item for
  another paid retry.
- **Delivery never overwrites.** A target that exists with different content
  is held as a conflict; an identical one counts as delivered, which makes
  re-collection idempotent. The source is re-hashed before writing; a source
  changed since submission holds its result.
- **Batch runs the selected model's settings.** `run` freezes the configured
  `samplingParams` and `extra_body` into the task exactly as realtime sends
  them (verbatim, `extra_body` merged last), and every retry reuses them.
  Disabled reasoning becomes the Qwen wire shape realtime uses
  (`reasoning_effort: "none"` for the tiered family, `enable_thinking: false`
  otherwise) and is only reported for other model families; an output limit
  is written under the budget key the frozen params already use
  (`max_completion_tokens` / `max_new_tokens`, else `max_tokens`).
- **No money figure without prices.** Token estimates are always shown
  (rough: ~4 characters per token for Latin text, ~1.5 for CJK). A dollar
  estimate needs
  `QWEN_BATCH_INPUT_PRICE_PER_1M_USD` / `QWEN_BATCH_OUTPUT_PRICE_PER_1M_USD`.
  The forecast leaves out thinking tokens and says so. A plan's
  `maxCostUsd` is enforced against the **worst case at the request caps**
  (each request's output cap plus its thinking bound: 0 with thinking off, a
  `thinking_budget` on non-tiered Qwen models), never against the forecast;
  without prices or without a finite bound it refuses to submit.
- **Accounting states its gaps.** Usage is summed over all attempts' result
  files; a line without usage marks the total incomplete, never a silent
  zero. Preparation in the session is invisible to the executor and every
  report says so. Batch usage stays out of the session's cache statistics.

### Independent Batch model selection

`settings.batch.model` selects an existing `modelProviders` entry independently
of the conversation model. `batch.authType` defaults to `openai`; optionally
use `batch.baseUrl` to disambiguate duplicate IDs. The match must be unique,
use chat-completions, and supply a base URL and populated envKey. Explicit
selection uses only that route's credentials and generationConfig; errors
never fall back to conversation settings. With no selection, preserve the
legacy main-model behavior. All commands and the interactive auto-collector
share this resolver. Restart after editing the selection. Acceptance: a
non-OpenAI conversation can check/submit/collect through the selected Batch
route; changing the main model does not change that route; missing, ambiguous
or unsupported selections fail before upload.

## 4. Plan schema (v1)

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "translate-docs",
  "kind": "document-transform",
  "completionWindow": "24h",
  "maxCostUsd": 2.0,
  "maxOutputTokens": 4096,
  "expectedOutputTokensPerItem": 1500,
  "shared": {
    "system": "optional system prompt",
    "instructions": "shared rules: terminology, style, output contract"
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "intro",
      "source": "docs/zh/intro.md",
      "target": "docs/en/intro.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Validated by `batch-task.ts` with zod `.strict()`:
  - item ids match `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]{0,59}`, since they ride inside
    the custom_id;
  - ids and targets are unique;
  - targets stay inside the project and outside every hidden path (`.git/`,
    `.github/`, `.qwen/`, … at any depth): delivery runs hours after approval
    with nobody watching, so it must not create files that configure tools or
    run code, and a target that could not be written is refused before
    anything is billed;
  - unknown fields fail loudly, so an agent's typo cannot silently change
    behavior.
- `kind` is a literal; a new kind gets a new schema version.
- `enableThinking` is set only when the user asks for it; `false` is refused
  for thinking-mandatory models.
- Product contract: **one source document → one complete target document**.
  The model returns content only; paths or commands in its output are data
  and are never executed.
- Delivery checks structure only: non-empty, not truncated
  (`finish_reason`), no tool calls. Semantic quality is the user's acceptance
  call.

Retry semantics:

- Only `failed` items and items held because their source changed, as a new
  attempt with fresh custom ids, under the same `maxCostUsd` gate.
- Refused while a submission is `submit-unknown`, or an earlier batch is
  still running or settled but uncollected.
- Items held on a target conflict are never retried: they need a user
  decision, not another request.

## 6. Waiting and collection (interactive sessions)

Waiting never runs the agent loop: HTTP polling does it, and the model is
involved only once, when results are in.

- **Background waiter (primary).** After `run`, the skill starts
  `qwen batch collect <task-id> --wait` with the shell tool's
  `is_background: true`. The process polls (10s → 60s), holds the task lock
  only to collect, writes the targets, prints a summary and exits. The shell
  registry then sends the model one `task-notification` with the output
  tail, which wakes the agent for exactly one turn. It is visible in
  `/tasks` and can be stopped there.
- **Auto-collector (fallback).** Covers sessions that closed before the
  batch settled, and batches submitted from outside the skill:
  - Starts after first render. Scans the local records for this project's open
    tasks, polls each over HTTP with a 1 → 5 minute backoff, and runs the same
    `collectTask` when a batch settles.
  - The first pass at startup collects tasks that finished while no session was
    open.
  - Results arrive as one info notice through the update-notice channel,
    queued while a response streams.
  - Guarantees:
    - No model call and no automatic retry; failed items only get the retry
      command.
    - Same safety as a manual collect: the same lock, idempotency and
      no-overwrite delivery.
    - What it cannot collect is said once: no usable Batch credentials, a
      submission with no matching provider batch, a task pinned to another
      endpoint or key (it backs off until the session switches back), or
      three failed passes in a row.
  - `general.batchAutoCollect` (default `true`) turns it off.
  - Not covered: headless, `qwen serve`, ACP, web-shell — no model-free notice
    channel there; use `qwen batch collect`.

## 7. Non-goals

- No automatic realtime/Batch routing, no paid probing, no auto-repair loops.
  The user picks the mode; the program keeps it honest.
- No multi-stage dependency graphs; one batch per attempt.
- No per-turn agent loop over Batch (measured and rejected in #11874).
- Only the document-transform contract. Code-patch delivery (apply, build,
  test) would be a new kind with its own acceptance checks.
