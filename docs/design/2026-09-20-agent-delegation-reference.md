# Moving the Agent Tool's Prompt-Writing Guidance into a Bundled Reference

[English](2026-09-20-agent-delegation-reference.md) | [简体中文](2026-09-20-agent-delegation-reference.zh-CN.md)

**Status:** implements one of the four acceptance items in [#12054](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/12054) — a size budget on the Agent description, for `agent` only; that issue stays open for the other three, and the PR body says `Part of` rather than `Closes`. Part of [#12028](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/12028). Builds on the Agent/Shell size budgets from [#12142](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/pull/12142) — landed as `36887c49` — whose rows this change lowers.

Every figure below was measured, not rendered on paper: the real `AgentTool` is constructed and its assembled `description` read, with the two subagent entries the budget test uses, team off, todo on. The _Before_ column is the same measurement with the two changed source files reverted to the merge base, so exactly one variable moves. Run locally on Linux — `packages/core` built, then 98 tests across the three affected files and 20 in the bundled-skills integration file, all passing, and every row of §3 reproduced from the constructed tool. The macOS and Windows unit jobs are `skipped` by CI for this PR rather than green, so nothing automated covers them; this is platform-independent string and module work, and `Desktop Shell (windows-2022)` does run. Token counts are characters ÷ 4, the same rough conversion the issue uses.

## 1. Problem

The Agent tool's description is the largest built-in tool description in the request, and it is sent on **every** request of **every** session, whether or not that turn delegates anything. About a quarter of it is craft advice for writing a delegation prompt: how much context to give, what not to delegate, what a fork prompt looks like, and a worked `test-runner` example. A turn that reads a file and answers a question pays for all of it.

The Workflow tool had the same shape and solved it in [#11013](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/11013): the authoring reference became the bundled `workflow-authoring` skill, and the description carries a pointer. That mechanism is reused here rather than reinvented.

## 2. What moved, and what deliberately did not

Moved into `packages/core/src/skills/bundled/agent-delegation/SKILL.md`:

- the `## Writing the prompt` section (the "smart colleague" briefing paragraph, its five bullets, "Terse command-style prompts…", and **Never delegate understanding**);
- the `**Writing a fork prompt.**` paragraph;
- two craft bullets from `Usage notes:` — "Provide clear, detailed prompts…" and "Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research…";
- the `<example_agent_descriptions>` / `isPrime` / `test-runner` worked example.

Kept in the description, on purpose, because a session that never loads the skill still has to get them right:

- when **not** to use the tool at all, and the reuse-an-existing-background-agent rule;
- the whole `## Working with background agents` section — **Don't peek**, **Don't race**, **Don't relaunch**;
- `## When to fork`'s call-shaping facts: a fork inherits the full conversation by default, `fork_turns` bounds it, `subagent_type` must be given, don't set `model` on a fork, pass a short `name`;
- concurrency and write-scope rules, `isolation`/`working_dir` semantics, and "treat the agent's output as evidence".

The split is the test's subject, not a comment: `SKILL.test.ts` asserts each moved anchor **is** in the skill and **is not** in the description a skill-capable session sends, and each kept anchor the other way round. Either half alone would let guidance vanish, or be pasted back, with every test green.

The text moved verbatim rather than being rewritten, with one addition and one deletion. The addition is a rule that a custom subagent's own definition outranks the dispatching prompt. #12142's review threads carry a real dispatch that asked a subagent defined as read-only over one file to search the whole repository, and the relocated "Provide clear, detailed prompts…" bullet encourages that override without ever saying whose contract wins. The rule sits in this reference rather than in the description because it is prompt-writing craft: a session that never loads the reference still cannot widen a subagent's tools, it only wastes the dispatch.

The deletion is one sentence, and it is a dedup rather than a loss. Base `agent.ts` carried "After launching an agent, do not fabricate or predict what it found before it returns. If the user asks a follow-up before the result arrives, provide status rather than guessing." The resident **Don't race** bullet already states the same rule more strongly — "Never fabricate or predict its results in any format…give status, not a guess" — and stays in the description in every shape, so carrying both would have charged every request for one instruction twice. `SKILL.test.ts` pins this: the dropped sentence appears in neither surface, and the surviving rule appears in all three shapes. A general compression pass on this description was reverted under review in #12142; keeping everything else to relocation keeps the two questions separable.

## 3. Measured effect

Description length read off the constructed tool, with the two subagent entries the budget test uses, team off, todo on:

| Shape                                                                             | chars  | ≈tokens |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Before                                                                            | 9,730  | 2,433   |
| After, pointer (a session that can load skills)                                   | 7,386  | 1,847   |
| After, pointer + bridge note (a `tools.eager` allowlist withholds the Skill tool) | 7,504  | 1,876   |
| After, reference withheld by `skills.disabled`                                    | 7,192  | 1,798   |
| After, reference inlined (no route to any skill)                                  | 10,412 | 2,603   |

So the normal case saves **2,344 characters ≈ 586 tokens per request**, against a 192-character pointer. The new skill costs one entry in the `<available_skills>` listing, which the session-start prelude carries in a user-role message rather than in the system prompt. That entry renders at **371 characters, ≈93 tokens** — measured through `renderAvailableSkillsBlock`, not the 247 of the frontmatter `description` alone, because the render adds the `<skill>` / `<name>` / `<description>` / `<location>` wrapper, a ` (bundled)` suffix, and XML-escapes the apostrophe in "the Agent tool's" to `&apos;`. The net is therefore **≈493 tokens per request for a session that never loads the skill** — which is most of them, and all of the ones this change exists for.

The 371 is linear only up to a cliff this accounting should name: `MAX_SKILL_LISTING_CHARS = 8000` (`environmentContext.ts:32`). Past it, `trimSkillEntriesTowardsBudget` (`:322-336`) keeps every `entry.level === 'bundled'` verbatim and reduces the other entries to their first description line, dropping `whenToUse`. The new entry is bundled — exempt from the trim it can trigger — and the snapshot is built once per session, so a crossing costs the user's own project and personal skills their `whenToUse` for the rest of that session while this entry stays whole. The entry is 372 characters of that budget (6,724 rendered with it, 6,352 without, over the repo's bundled references), so the band is narrow but real; whether any given deployment sits in it is not measured here, and the probe that found the trim used synthetic project skills. What §3 omitted is the discontinuity, not a figure.

**A session that does load it ends up worse off, and the earlier draft of this paragraph hid that.** The Skill tool returns the whole body as `llmContent`, so the ~3,270 characters enter the conversation and are re-sent on every subsequent turn; a repeat load only answers "is already loaded in context", and while `skill` is in `COMPACTABLE_TOOLS` the clearing needs an idle gap of at least an hour or more than 500,000 characters of context. Per turn after the load: −2,344 (description) + 371 (listing) + ~3,270 (body in history) = **+1,297 characters ≈ +324 tokens worse than baseline**.

So this is a bet on the mix, not a free win: the briefing prose used to be paid by every session, and now it is paid only by the ones that delegate — once, and then for the rest of that session. It is the right bet where most sessions never delegate, and the wrong one for a deployment whose sessions almost all brief an agent. The same arithmetic applies to the `workflow-authoring` reference this follows, which never stated it.

The bridge variant costs 118 characters more than the plain pointer: one sentence telling the model to review the Skill tool's schema with `tool_search` and then invoke it with `tool_call`. (It cost 77 while that sentence still said "reveal it with ToolSearch first"; main reworded it to name both halves of the bridge, because `tool_search` alone can review a schema but never invoke it, and this reference inherits the shared wording.)

The inline shape is 682 characters larger than today's description, and that 682 decomposes exactly: 127 for the inline preamble and its `---` separator, 265 for the reference's own title and framing paragraph, and 465 for the precedence rule with its blank line, less 175 because the relocated prose reads shorter inside the reference than it did in the description's bullet list. Only the precedence rule is new text rather than relocated text. The total is the deliberate price for sessions that cannot load a skill — a pointer there would name something the model cannot reach — and a pointer-shaped session pays none of it, because only the inline shape carries the reference body at all.

## 4. How the route is decided

`skills/bundled-reference.ts` is the `workflow-authoring` logic extracted so the two references cannot drift, plus the bridge helpers both need. It answers four cases, once, when the tool is constructed:

| Route                   | Condition                                                                                                                       | Description carries           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `skill`                 | a skill manager exists and the Skill tool is registered                                                                         | pointer                       |
| `skill-via-tool-search` | the Skill tool's schema can be withheld by a `tools.eager` allowlist, and **both** `tool_search` and `tool_call` are registered | pointer + the bridge sentence |
| `inline`                | no route to any skill (skills off, Skill tool denied, or deferred without the full bridge)                                      | the reference in full         |
| `withheld`              | the user turned this reference off by name or disabled the whole bundled level                                                  | nothing                       |

The bridge row is decided on reachability, not registration: under `ToolMode.CodeModeOnly` both bridge tools are hidden (`code-mode.ts` `HIDDEN_TOOLS`), so the deferral arm is skipped and the route stays `skill` — a plain pointer stays honest there because a deferred Skill tool remains callable through the `exec` binding. Because the resolver is shared, that is also a **route change for the Workflow reference #11013 shipped**, not only a rule for the new one: a CodeModeOnly session with a permission-deferred Skill tool resolved to `skill-via-tool-search` before this PR and resolves to `skill` now. Two rows pin it, both added by this PR rather than pre-existing: `workflow-authoring-skill.test.ts` on the Workflow route, and `SKILL.test.ts`'s `points straight at the skill when CodeModeOnly hides the bridge` on the Agent route — where the guard matters more, because `AgentTool` freezes its surface in the constructor while the Workflow description re-asks per turn.

The bridge route requires both halves because `tool_search` only reviews a schema — invoking still goes through `tool_call`, so a session with `tool_search` alone has no usable route and must be given the reference inline. That gate came from main after this branch was cut; because the decision now lives in one shared module, both references picked it up in the same merge rather than drifting.

`AgentTool` resolves this in its constructor and stores it, so a mid-session `/skills` toggle cannot make two `refreshSubagents()` rebuilds disagree about where the reference lives. Registration order makes that safe: every core tool is registered as a lazy factory before any is constructed, so the Skill tool is already in `getAllToolNames()` when the Agent tool is built.

`workflow-authoring-skill.ts` keeps all of its exported names and now delegates to the shared module, so #11013's callers and tests are untouched.

## 5. Blast radius

- **Every request** carries the shorter Agent declaration. Nested agent launches and forks inherit the same description.
- **#12142's budget tests** are lowered to the new measurements, each at measured length plus 364–380 on the three lowered description rows and 720 on the whole-surface row (#12142's own margins were 430–490, so "the same headroom as that PR" would have been wrong too) (default 10,200 → 7,750; no-subagents 9,900 → 7,450; all blocks on 11,200 → 8,750; whole model-visible surface 14,200 → 11,750). Those four lowered rows — three description ceilings plus the whole-surface total — bound the **pointer** shape only, the one almost every session sends. A fifth pointer row is new rather than lowered: the bridge shape, 7,504 → 7,900, with a separate ≤160 bound on the bridge sentence's own delta, which is the only guard on the 118 characters §3 itemises. The inline route is bounded by three rows of its own: description 10,412 → 10,750; description with the team block also on 11,396 → 11,770, the real worst case, and above the 11,200 the all-blocks-on shape used to be capped at; whole surface 14,056 → 14,430, which is above the 13,374 every session paid before this PR, because a reference that cannot be loaded costs more per turn than the prose it replaced did. The pointer-vs-inline gap is pinned on the reference body itself rather than on a magnitude: a magnitude floor cannot see guidance pasted back into the description, where both shapes grow together and the 7,750 row fires first, and the only change that reached it alone was a legitimate trim of the reference — measured, 1,350 characters drops the gap from 3,026 to 1,675.
- **`agent.test.ts`**: six assertion sites anchored on text that moved were removed, five of them re-anchored in place, and a seventh was deliberately retained. All seven would have kept passing untouched, because that file's stub `Config` has no `getSkillManager`, so the route is `inline` and the description embeds the whole `SKILL.md` body — every moved anchor is still in it. The five are re-anchored on facts the description keeps in every shape (don't set `model` on a fork, forks inherit the full parent conversation by default, pass a short `name`, and "Choose a fork when the task needs substantial context"). The sixth, `toContain('Writing the prompt')`, is asserted in `SKILL.test.ts`'s pointer case instead: after the split that heading belongs to the pointer rather than to the inlined body, and no other test carries it. The retained seventh is `toContain('Never delegate understanding')` (`:989`, unchanged from base `:979`), kept as this file's pin on the inline shape: its dependence on the stub is disclosed in the test's own comment (`:984-987`), and the inlined body is separately asserted verbatim at `agent-description-budget.test.ts:255`, so a truncated or section-split inline arm is caught there rather than here.
- **The skills listing** gains one bundled entry, listed in `/skills` and gated by `skills.disabled` / `skills.enabled` like any other. It reaches the model through the session-start prelude's `<available_skills>` block — a user-role message, not the system prompt — at the 371 rendered characters costed in §3.
- **Bundling** needs nothing new: `scripts/copy_bundle_assets.js` and `scripts/copy_files.js` copy `skills/bundled/**` recursively, and `bundled-skills.integration.test.ts` parses every shipped `SKILL.md`, so the new directory is covered by both.
- **No prompt, snapshot, or ACP surface** references the moved text: the only files naming it were `agent.ts` and `agent.test.ts`.

## 6. Risks

**A model that never loads the skill writes a worse prompt.** That is the accepted trade, bounded by what stayed resident: the launch rules, the safety rules, and the fork facts that shape the call are all still in the description, so a session that skips the reference still calls the tool correctly — it just briefs the agent less well. The skill's own description names what it holds, which is what lets the model decide whether this turn needs it.

**A recall regression would not show up in unit tests.** Whether models actually load the reference before writing a delegation prompt is an evaluation question, not an assertion; and no instrument measures it: #12333 is where that gate is tracked, and it has no owner — the umbrella #12028 does not carry one.

**The resident "treat the agent's output as evidence" bullet stays unqualified.** The precedence rule lives in the reference, so a session that never loads it still reads that bullet with nothing saying that a subagent whose definition makes its result authoritative is a different case. Qualifying it in the description would cost every turn of every session what only a dispatching turn needs — the trade this whole change exists to undo — so that half stays with #12142's threads.

## 7. Validation

- `packages/core/src/skills/bundled/agent-delegation/SKILL.test.ts` — the two-way split table (its kept half also asserts each anchor is absent from the frontmatter the session-start listing charges for), the pointer's wording and its `## Writing the prompt` heading, the precedence rule, the inline shape, the CodeModeOnly route row, the withheld shape (asserted with the Skill tool both registered and absent, since the opt-out outranks the lack of a route, and once for each of the two opt-out levers), and the don't-predict dedup.
- `packages/core/src/tools/agent/agent-description-budget.test.ts` — the lowered budgets, the inline ceilings (description, description plus the optional blocks, and the whole surface), and the pointer-vs-inline body check: the reference body verbatim in the inline shape, and none of its paragraphs in the pointer.
- `packages/core/src/skills/bundled-reference.test.ts` — the read cache both references share: each fill order read cold through one module instance, the base directory following the name, and a repeated read answered from the cache.
- `packages/core/src/tools/workflow/workflow-description.test.ts` — unchanged, and it pins that the Workflow description's own shapes did not move. `packages/core/src/skills/workflow-authoring-skill.test.ts` is **not** unchanged: this PR adds 27 lines to it (a `ToolMode` import, the `toolMode` stub field and `getToolMode`, the CodeModeOnly route row, and a `resolveWorkflowAuthoringSurface` row) and touches no existing line, so its pre-existing rows are what pins that the extraction did not change #11013's routing — and a red there reads as "a row this PR added is wrong", not as "an unchanged pin broke".
- `packages/core/src/skills/bundled-skills.integration.test.ts` — the new `SKILL.md` parses with `name` matching its directory.
