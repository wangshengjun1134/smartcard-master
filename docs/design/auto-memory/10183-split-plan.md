# Structured recall: three-PR delivery plan

Source: #10183 at `38b9b7ce8f7cbc03537cd2bff2b294c8e1e267f4`.

The objective is to land the original structured on-demand recall capability
in dependency order. Line-count reduction is not an acceptance criterion.
Foundation code with a concrete downstream owner belongs in the split even
before the final runtime is enabled. Simplification must preserve the agreed
capabilities and their correctness dependencies.

## Merge order

1. **#12726 — structured memory data and retrieval.** Metadata parsing and
   validation, trusted scans, source completeness, scoped references, tree
   rendering, search/fetch/explore, body windows and cursor validation.
   The structured scanner is separate from the existing scanner so the
   legacy parser, recall, forget and index candidate universe stay intact.
   The engine is callable and independently testable; model registration and
   default activation belong to PR 3. No session-token saving is claimed.
2. **#12757 — migration and writer compatibility.** Body-preserving atomic
   metadata migration, corpus readiness, writer vocabulary, and necessary
   Remember/Extraction/Dream adapters. Depends on PR 1. Preserve legacy
   recall until activation. Background scheduling and protocol switching
   remain in PR 3; do not add an unrelated Dream scheduling feature.
3. **#10183 — runtime integration and activation.** Config/manager, CLI and
   ACP delivery, model-facing tool registration, selection, body residency,
   compaction invalidation, migration scheduling, activation/rollback and
   the telemetry needed to measure the result. Depends on PRs 1 and 2.

Each PR targets main when its predecessors have landed. Until then, the
second PR can target the first branch to show only its incremental diff.
The original PR is reduced after the extracted changes land; do not delete
its source work or rewrite its shared history during extraction.

## Review constraints

- Preserve every core capability across the three PRs; record any intentional
  simplification with its replacement and consumer.
- Do not enable an extra project root in legacy recall/forget. Before the
  structured runtime enables multiple roots, resolve identity collisions,
  deletion of physical copies and index rebuilding for the affected root.
- Keep body residency and compaction invalidation in the same runtime PR.
- Do not activate metadata-only prompts before the body retrieval tool is
  registered, discoverable and usable.
- Keep migration readiness and activation/rollback consistent. Partial or
  unreadable sources cannot be declared ready.
- Review source code rather than trusting old descriptions or green tests.

## Verification and measurement

PR 1: focused parser/scan/tree/retrieval tests plus legacy scan compatibility.
PR 2: migration body preservation, concurrent edit rejection, partial failure,
and relevant writer tests. PR 3: first-turn recall, irrelevant-memory control,
fetch/re-fetch, changed files, compaction, tool discovery and CLI/ACP parity.
Use targeted local checks; leave whole-repository validation to remote CI.

## PR 2 extraction boundary

The migration engine is callable but not scheduled. Remember and Extraction
reuse the bounded vocabulary; Dream receives the structured format guidance
without changing its legacy file/index operations. Maintenance agents retain
their own writer instructions rather than inheriting session routing.

The following original changes remain owned by PR 3: user-mutation scheduling,
user Dream, runtime-managed Dream deletion manifests, Dream vocabulary/root
integration, and switching the session prompt to metadata-first delivery.
In particular, do not introduce a new Dream scan that reads protected pinned
files merely to collect keywords.

PR 2 adds metadata guidance to existing writer/session prompts. It does change
their size, in both directions: measured from base `65254472` to `4f6e6e56`, the
main session prompt grew by 1,417 characters and Remember by 1,764, while the
extraction prompt shrank by 12,341 and the Dream prompt by 3,829 — the two
background agents moved to the bounded `renderWriterKeywordVocabularySnapshot`
instead of an inline vocabulary dump. Those are prompt-character deltas, not a
measured end-to-end token saving, and the transitional growth on the session
prompt must still be included when measuring the final runtime against main.

Only PR 3 can substantiate session-token savings. Compare the same corpus,
task, model and settings. Report main-model input, selector/migration/Dream
usage and cache reads separately. Disabling auto memory is not an implemented
optimization. Original PR benchmark numbers do not establish split-PR gains.
