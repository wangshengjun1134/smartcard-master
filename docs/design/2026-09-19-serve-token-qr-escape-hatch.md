# Serve token QR escape hatch and degraded address-only QR

## Problem statement

Since #11172, `qwen serve` on a non-loopback bind prints a token-bearing QR at
startup that encodes `<lan-url>/#token=<bearer>` — QR delivery decoupled from
Local Control. The QR is withheld when the bearer is a **stable
operator-supplied token** and stdout is **not an interactive terminal**:

```ts
if (!input.generated && !process.stdout.isTTY) return;
```

The guard upholds a real invariant — an operator-configured long-lived
credential must never be republished into captured stdout (journald, container
logs, log aggregation) on every restart, because logs usually live in a wider
access-control domain than the secret's configured storage.

But the guard's current shape has three defects:

1. **Silent suppression.** Nothing is printed when the QR is withheld. The
   operator cannot discover why, short of reading the source.
2. **No escape hatch.** `isTTY` cannot distinguish "operator tails the log
   from an SSH terminal and would scan the QR off the screen" (safe) from
   "stdout is shipped to ELK" (leak). The daemon cannot see the deciding
   variable; the operator can — yet has no flag to express it.
3. **Over-broad penalty.** The guard suppresses the QR _mechanism_ together
   with the _secret_. An address-only QR carries zero marginal disclosure —
   the same addresses are already printed as plain text lines — and the Web
   Shell's `StandaloneAuth` gate already asks for the token when the URL
   carries none.

## Current state

`printRemoteQuickstart` (`packages/cli/src/serve/remote-quickstart.ts`) prints,
on a non-loopback bind: address lines, the generated-token line (ephemeral
tokens only), a plaintext warning when not TLS, then the QR block. The QR
block requires the Web Shell (`web`), picks one dialable private-LAN candidate
(preferring routable over link-local), falls back to a "QR unavailable" line
when no candidate exists, and then applies the suppression guard above.

## Proposed changes

All changes are confined to the startup quickstart block; Local Control, the
auth model, and the Web Shell are untouched.

### 1. `--token-qr` escape hatch

New boolean flag on `qwen serve` (no default — omission is distinguished from
`--no-token-qr`), plus a settings.json source `serve.tokenQr` (same
precedence pattern as `serve.channels`: the `serve` object in
`settingsSchema.ts`). When enabled, the token-bearing QR is printed even in the
suppressed case (stable operator token + non-interactive stdout). The operator
thereby declares: _my log pipeline is as trusted as the daemon host._ An
explicit flag of either polarity wins; the setting applies only when the flag
is omitted. Default behavior is unchanged.

Plumbing: `ServeArgs['token-qr']` → `ServeOptions.tokenQr`, and
`serve.tokenQr` via the serve fast-path settings summary
(`fast-path-settings.ts`); the flag takes precedence at the single
`printRemoteQuickstart` call site in `run-qwen-serve.ts`. Resolving the
settings source there — not in the yargs command layer — keeps the serve fast
path (which never runs the yargs handler) identical in behavior.

### 2. Suppression hint line

When the token-bearing QR is suppressed, print one line naming the reason and
the remedy:

```text
Token-bearing QR suppressed: stable operator token with non-interactive stdout. Pass --token-qr to print it anyway.
```

An explicit `--no-token-qr` veto gets its own attribution instead of advice to
pass the flag just passed, and it suppresses the quickstart token QR on
**every quickstart** path — interactive terminal and generated token included —
so the negated polarity is a real off-switch rather than a no-op that prints
the credential anyway. (A generated bearer still reaches the operator as its
own plain-text line, so the veto costs access to nothing.) The claim is scoped
to this block on purpose: `--local-control` prints its own pairing QR, and
since Local Control requires a loopback bind — where the quickstart block never
prints — an unqualified "every path" would tell an operator that no credential
QR can reach the log on a run that is in fact printing one.

```text
Token-bearing QR suppressed: the token QR was explicitly disabled for this run.
```

If the token QR was requested (flag or setting) but none can print, say why on
stderr rather than discarding the request silently — the Web Shell unmounted
(`--no-web`, or unresolved assets) and the loopback bind (which prints no QR:
`quickstartPrintMode` returns `token-only` or `silent` there, and a generated
bearer still gets its own plain-text line) each get their own cause:

```text
qwen serve: --token-qr / serve.tokenQr has no effect because the Web Shell is not mounted.
qwen serve: --token-qr / serve.tokenQr has no effect on this bind: a loopback listener prints no quickstart QR.
```

A present-but-malformed `serve.tokenQr` (a string, a number) is reported on
stderr — naming the field and its type, never its value — and treated as
absent. The value is left out because a malformed value may be a literal token
pasted into the setting, and a `${VAR}` placeholder outside
`INTERNAL_SECRET_ENV_VARS` is substituted before it reaches the diagnostic —
echoing either would re-publish a live bearer into captured stderr on every
boot. The check lives in the consumer, not in the shared fast-path settings
reader: throwing there would discard the whole boot summary — `policy.*` and
`serve.channels` with it — so a typo in a display knob would silently
downgrade permission mediation to its default.

### 3. Degraded address-only QR

In the suppressed case, still print a QR encoding the bare candidate URL (no
`#token=` fragment), labeled so the operator knows the phone will be asked for
the token:

```text
Scan to open Web Shell: <url> (<label>)
Address-only QR: the Web Shell will ask for the bearer token.
<QR>
```

The address-only QR is printed through the same candidate selection and the
same best-effort `qrcode-terminal` path as today; it simply encodes less.

## Scope boundaries

- No change to the generated-token or interactive-TTY paths **by default** —
  the full token QR still prints there unless an explicit `--no-token-qr`
  vetoes it, which degrades both to the address-only QR (see the veto row
  above). A settings-level `false` is not a veto: the veto signal is derived
  from the flag alone (the printer's resolved `tokenQrMode` is `'veto'` only
  when `opts.tokenQr === false`), so a settings
  `false` only declines the opt-in and leaves the default policy suppression
  in charge.
- No change to `token-only`/`silent` loopback modes.
- No change to Local Control, its listener model, or its pairing token.
- No Web Shell changes; `StandaloneAuth` token entry is used as-is.
- No retry/persistence of the QR; it remains a one-shot startup block.

## Validation plan

Unit tests in `remote-quickstart.test.ts` cover: suppression hint text,
address-only QR payload (must not contain the token in raw or encoded form),
`--token-qr` forcing the token-bearing QR, the veto's degraded output on the
generated-token and TTY paths, and unchanged **default** behavior for
generated-token/TTY/no-web/no-candidate paths. E2E plan:
`.qwen/e2e-tests/serve-token-qr.md` — baseline against the globally
installed CLI, then the same matrix against `node dist/cli.js`.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Stable token + redirected stdout prints the hint line and an address-only
   QR; no line contains the token in raw or URL-encoded form.
2. `--token-qr` with a stable token and redirected stdout prints the
   token-bearing QR with the existing SECRET warning.
3. With no `--token-qr` / `--no-token-qr` flag, generated-token, interactive
   TTY, `--no-web`, and no-candidate outputs are byte-identical to before.
4. `qwen serve --help` lists `--token-qr`.

## Open questions

None.
