# Orphan-reap worktree cleanup (#11024 item 1)

[English](channel-worktree-orphan-reap.md) | [简体中文](channel-worktree-orphan-reap.zh-CN.md)

## Status

Implemented and verified (2026-09-07). Two real-daemon A/B rounds: the
first caught the `supersedes` classification defect (a post-reset
replacement could never be cleaned — rule 3 was revised accordingly);
the second confirmed the happy path, the tombstone variant, the
superseded-predecessor skip, and all preserved-by-design states.
Pre-existing gap noted by verification (out of scope): a `worktree-reset`
requested without source metadata leaves the replacement with no
transcript record, and `/sessions/delete` answers `notFound` for it.

## Problem

When the daemon definitively deletes a session that owned a worktree, the
checkout and its branch are never removed. Crash/reap cycles and operator
deletes therefore leak worktrees and branches permanently (flagged by
yiliang114 on #10643, `session-archive.ts:656`).

## Leak map (real daemon, measured)

Scenario: channel worktree session (`POST /session` with `worktree:{}`),
artifacts = JSONL record, sidecar `<chatsDir>/<sid>.worktree.json`,
in-worktree marker `.qwen-session`, checkout
`W/.qwen/worktrees/<slug>` (git-registered), branch `worktree-<slug>`.

| Path                                             | Record      | Sidecar     | Checkout   | Marker     | Branch     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Bridge idle reaper (worker crash)                | kept        | kept        | kept       | kept       | kept       |
| `POST /sessions/delete` (`deleteDaemonSessions`) | **deleted** | **deleted** | **leaked** | **leaked** | **leaked** |
| `DELETE /session/:id`                            | kept        | kept        | kept       | kept       | kept       |

- The idle reaper deletes nothing persisted; the session stays
  restorable. Not a leak in the sense of this issue.
- `POST /sessions/delete` is **the** deletion path that actually removes
  a worktree-owning session's record, and it destroys the sidecar (the
  ownership evidence) as part of the record deletion. Confirmed for both
  idle-live and reaped sessions.
- No production flow ever reaches `deleteDaemonSessionIfOrphan` for a
  worktree-owning session (6 sessions / 6 reaps / 5 deletes driven; its
  static call sites are rollback/keepalive paths that either never own
  worktrees or self-clean via request-local `worktreeMeta`).
- After deletion, later restores answer 404 `session_not_found`; the
  leftover marker's session id simply dangles.

## Decision

Arm the cleanup at **`deleteDaemonSessions`** — the one real leak path —
covering both its production call sites (REST `POST /sessions/delete` and
ACP `qwen/sessions/delete`) uniformly by placing the cleanup inside the
shared function, not at each route.

`deleteDaemonSessionIfOrphan` is deliberately **not** armed: the evidence
shows no production flow reaches it for a worktree-owning session, its
named call sites must stay unarmed (ACP dispatch rollback, scheduled-task
keepalive, Part 4B reset rollback), and the create-route reap sites
already self-clean request-local worktrees. Adding an unused opt-in
there would be a dead switch.

Because `deleteDaemonSessions` destroys the sidecar as part of the record
deletion, cleanup classification must happen **before** the record is
deleted, and execution **after** the deletion is confirmed.

## Concurrency and lock order

Restores (Part 4A) and the reset route (Part 4B) serialize worktree
operations on a promise chain keyed by the canonical worktree path
(`acquireWorktreeOwnershipOp`), taken **before** any session-archive
coordinator lock (reset route: worktree lock →
`deleteDaemonSessionIfOrphan` → coordinator). Cleanup must follow the
same order — worktree lock first, coordinator second — or the two orders
can deadlock (AB-BA).

- The ownership-op lock moves from a route-local closure to a shared
  module keyed by canonical worktree path alone (the serialized resource
  is the on-disk checkout; bridge-scoping was only a GC convenience and
  release-on-finally already bounds the map). Path-keying is strictly
  more conservative and frees the cleanup from bridge-identity concerns
  across the REST and ACP call sites.
- When `deleteDaemonSessions` runs with `coordinatorLockHeld: true`
  (internal live-conversation runtimes, where the outer batch lock is
  already held), cleanup is **skipped**: taking the worktree lock there
  would invert the order, and internal runtimes never own Part 4A
  worktrees.
- Each delete takes exactly one worktree lock (its own candidate's), so
  concurrent batch deletes need no multi-lock ordering — two sessions
  sharing a checkout serialize on the same key and the loser
  re-classifies against post-delete state.

## Safety contract

Cleanup fires only when the whole ownership chain verifies; any doubt
preserves the checkout and logs a named warning (a `qwen serve:` stderr
line via `writeStderrLine`).

Classification (before record deletion, under the worktree lock):

1. Strict sidecar read (`readWorktreeSessionStrict`). `missing` → not a
   worktree owner, no cleanup. `invalid` → preserve + log. The archived
   location is checked too — the sidecar moves with the record.
2. Sidecar without `workspaceCwd` (legacy tool worktree) → preserve
   silently; not daemon-route-owned.
3. Sidecar carrying `supersededBy` → skip **silently**: the expected
   post-reset state (the checkout belongs to the replacement now), so
   preserve-and-log keeps its meaning. A sidecar carrying `supersedes`
   means this session IS the current owner after a reset and stays
   cleanable — the first A/B round proved the stricter reading (skip on
   any link) makes every post-reset session's worktree permanently
   uncleanable, which fails this design's own goal.
4. Marker strict read (`readWorktreeSessionMarkerStrict`) must be
   `valid` and name exactly the session being deleted.
5. Path containment: the checkout must resolve under the workspace's
   worktree roots (`<ws>/.qwen/worktrees` or the repo top-level
   equivalent, same allowed-roots derivation as the create route).
6. Cross-session sharing: a scan of the sidecar dir's `*.worktree.json`
   must find no **other** session's sidecar naming the same (canonical)
   worktree path. A tombstone predecessor (`supersededBy` naming
   exactly the session being deleted) legitimately names the same
   checkout — it is evidence of the transfer, not sharing.

Execution (after confirmed deletion, still under the worktree lock):

7. **Gate on the actual deletion**: only `kind === 'removed'` /
   `mutationApplied` — never `notFound` or error shapes, mirroring the
   create route's `if (removed)` gate.
8. Re-verify the marker (unchanged, still naming the deleted session) —
   closes the out-of-band window classification can't see.
9. The shared `worktreeHasWork` predicate
   (`packages/core/src/services/gitWorktreeService.ts`) must report no
   work: a full `git status --porcelain` walk with **untracked files
   included**, and git-ignored ones too, so an agent-written file that
   was never committed counts as work and preserves the checkout. This is
   the deliberate choice behind the safety contract's "any doubt
   preserves": tracked and committed work was already protected, and
   extending the gate to untracked files costs one `git status` walk per
   delete while closing the "silently destroyed draft" hole the
   tracked-only variant left open. That predicate is also the enumeration
   of record for the exemptions (disposable build output, symlinks, and
   the daemon's own `.qwen-session` marker when git lists it as untracked
   or ignored), so this doc deliberately does not restate them: the CLI
   startup sweep and this reaper both call it and cannot drift apart.
   Read errors fail closed to "has work". The bridge session was closed
   before the record deletion, so no in-daemon writer can dirty the
   checkout afterwards.
10. `removeUserWorktree(slug, { deleteBranch: true })` — never
    `forceDeleteBranch`. Log the `branchPreserved` outcome so "checkout
    removed, branch kept for unmerged commits" is distinguishable from
    "checkout kept, ownership doubtful".

## Failure semantics

- The session record deletion proceeds exactly as today regardless of
  the cleanup classification: a preserved checkout never blocks the
  delete, and a failed `removeUserWorktree` is logged and otherwise
  ignored (the leak it leaves is the status quo, never worse).
- A crash between record deletion and worktree removal leaves the
  previous leak shape; a future sweep can recover it (out of scope).

## Out of scope

- Periodic/startup orphan-worktree sweep for the crash/reap leak shape
  (record kept, everything kept — nothing is lost, just idle).
- Arming `deleteDaemonSessionIfOrphan` (no production reach; see
  Decision).
- Removing leftover sidecar/marker when the checkout is preserved
  (preserved means ownership doubt; the sidecar is the evidence a later
  repair needs).

## Test plan

Unit (`session-archive.test.ts`, real git repos + real sidecars/markers
in temp dirs):

- Happy path: delete removes record + checkout + branch + marker.
- Gate: `notFound` (record absent, sidecar present) → checkout kept.
- Superseded sidecar → kept, and no warning logged (silent skip).
- Legacy sidecar (no `workspaceCwd`) → kept.
- Invalid sidecar → kept + warning.
- Marker missing / mismatched / invalid → kept + warning.
- Cross-session sharing (second sidecar, same path) → kept + warning.
- Containment failure (checkout outside allowed roots) → kept + warning.
- Dirty checkout (tracked modification) → kept + warning.
- Unmerged commits in the worktree branch → checkout removed, branch
  kept, `branchPreserved` logged.
- `coordinatorLockHeld: true` → cleanup skipped (checkout kept) even
  when fully verified.

E2E (real daemon A/B): repeat the leak-map scenario 3/4 — after
`POST /sessions/delete`, the checkout, marker, registration, and branch
are gone; a dirty checkout variant stays.
