# ACP Bridge execution engines

[English](./acp-bridge-execution-engines.md) | [简体中文](./acp-bridge-execution-engines.zh-CN.md)

## Status

Implementation plan for the Stage B Bridge slice of #12380, based on upstream
`790bd83c2b`. This slice supplies an opt-in Bridge construction API. Ordinary
serve factories and the Hosted model/tool loop are separate integration work.

## Problem and current behavior

The Bridge owns one reusable ACP channel and one startup promise. Sessions
already keep their own channel and connection, but callbacks look up sessions
through a shared ID map without consistently checking the sending channel.
Adding a second engine must preserve shared admission, reservations, replay,
and physical cleanup rather than duplicating the session control plane.

## Scope

Support Legacy and Managed channels inside one Bridge, fixed session ownership,
engine receipts, channel-scoped callbacks, and complete lifecycle accounting.
Keep existing callers of `channelFactory` compatible.

This change does not implement a Managed Harness, write owner records, select
compatible deployment configurations, wire the ordinary serve factories,
change the public REST API, or implement Stage G takeover. Managed branching
remains unavailable. Workspace control and preheat remain on the Legacy channel.

## Proposed design

### Construction and ownership contract

`executionEngines` contains `legacy` and `managed` factories and a server-owned
`select` callback. It is mutually exclusive with `channelFactory`. Selection
receives a snapshot of the validated spawn/load/resume request, including the
canonical workspace and trusted standalone purpose. It returns only `legacy`
or `managed`. Client metadata cannot override selection.

Selection runs after shared capacity and ID reservation, with the operation
already visible to shutdown. Cold load/resume requires the caller's selector
to read verified durable ownership; ambiguous or unreadable history must reject.
Hot attach uses the existing entry without invoking the selector again. A branch
checks its source engine on cold restore, hot attach and coalesced restore.
The selector retains its original receiver, including prototype methods.

Paired channels require the actual ACP new/load/resume response to contain
`_meta['qwen.session.executionEngine']` matching the selected engine. This key
matches the pinned design/reference implementation. The host must persist or
verify ownership before returning this receipt and before initialization side
effects. A receipt is a trusted host assertion, not a filesystem proof performed
by the Bridge. The generic single-factory API does not require this receipt.

Owner persistence stays outside this package. #12693 currently introduces its
reader and writer foundations; the issue discussion must still settle the
minimal dependency and the relationship between `session_execution_engine`
and `managed_session_header_v1`. This slice does not create another format or
require all of Stage G. Production enablement requires that host integration.
The Legacy host receipt, owner persistence and the cold-restore selector are
specified in the B2a follow-up,
[Paired engine owner selection and typed rejections](./2026-09-26-paired-engine-owner-selection.md).
Host wiring and the selection rules for new sessions are specified in the B2d
design, [Paired engine host wiring](./2026-09-26-paired-engine-host-wiring.md).
The [ordinary-host Managed engine](./2026-09-27-ordinary-host-managed-engine.md)
design settles the relationship: a Managed session is a Managed Session log
whose first transaction records the owner and then the header.

### Channels and admission

Keep one `byId`, default attach entry, ID reservation map, admission budget,
runtime epoch source and set of physically owned channels. Add engine slots for
reusable channels and startup promises. Coalesce startup within an engine;
allow the two engines to start independently. Track dying generations until
physical exit. Channel quarantine blocks fresh work only for that engine.

Idle timers belong to the actual channel. Unbound spawns and restores protect
channels until their work transfers to a channel counter. Binding or settling
these operations rechecks deferred idle timers, including timers consumed while
selection had not yet bound an owner. An unrelated idle channel must not wait
for the selected engine's restore RPC or cleanup to finish. Re-evaluation rearms
only deferred timers without extending another channel's existing idle deadline.
Bare Legacy preheat at idle timeout zero remains timer-free until that channel
is used; unrelated Managed work must not activate its idle cleanup. A settlement
uses a snapshot of its channels and cannot reclaim a replacement published later.
A late exit from an old generation must not cancel another channel's timer.
Runtime-operation reservations protect only their engine's channels; workspace
activity and stop checks still count reservations across both engines.
Shutdown awaits every engine startup, selection, session operation and owned
channel; force shutdown reaches all
tracked children. No failure path switches to the other factory.

### Registration and cleanup

Before dispatch, reject an unaddressable caller-supplied ID or an ID already
owned by a live session, using the typed rejection defined in the B2a
follow-up. Before registration, check the actual engine receipt
and the returned session ID. Invalid, conflicting or missing receipts reject
registration. Close a safely addressable unregistered session on its original connection. If its ID
cannot be safely addressed, quarantine the original channel, let other sessions
drain, and retain admission until physical exit. Never close another session
merely because a malformed response returned its ID.

Quarantine recovery follows the #12737 decision and is specified in
[paired engine per-engine operations](./2026-09-26-paired-engine-per-engine-operations.md)
(B2c). A quarantined channel admits no new prompt, message from another
session or side request. Until its termination begins it admits background
notification turns, which report work that already exists, except on a
session that a tightening workspace change has fenced. It closes its settled
sessions, retires once it drains, and is terminated at a drain deadline
measured once from the start of the quarantine. Admission,
IDs and owners stay held until the channel's exit is observed, and the engine
stays closed to fresh sessions until the child's process tree is released.

Restore failures after a successful ACP response use the same original-channel
cleanup discipline. Public timeout is not evidence of physical completion.
A late success without a session ID remains a success requiring cleanup or quarantine; it is distinct
from an explicit RPC failure.
Keep reservations until the original operation settles and cleanup completes.
The cleanup fence covers receipt rejection as well as timeout; its retry hint
is a backoff policy, not an estimate of when cleanup will complete.

### Live routing and workspace operations

Prompt, cancellation, approvals, model changes and session close use the entry's
bound connection. Inbound session lookups, restore replay, background admission,
and generation events must also match the sending channel/connection. Live
transcript reads, turn-index reads and flushes use that owner as well; only
persisted reads without a live entry use the Legacy workspace fallback.

Workspace MCP, configuration/status control and preheat use Legacy. Aggregate
liveness and activity inspect both engines; idle reclamation locates the actual
candidate by ID. Preheat keepalive extends only Legacy's idle deadline. Managed
sessions and in-flight work prevent their own channel from being reclaimed;
Managed has no preheat or keepalive of its own, and resource sampling does not
keep it up. Child resource sampling covers every live channel, and a
user-language change reaches every live engine; a Managed channel that starts
later is sent the last change before its first session. B2c specifies both.

Production paired-host wiring is also blocked on these workspace contracts:

- Separate aggregate runtime liveness from Legacy workspace-control readiness.
  Coordinator preheat decisions and workspace-service readiness must check the
  capability they need; Managed alone cannot make Legacy preheat successful.
- Define capability generations independently of the shared epoch allocator.
  Starting Managed must not invalidate unchanged Legacy skills/MCP preparation,
  and losing Legacy must invalidate its capabilities even if Managed survives.
  Workspace-stop confirmation must retain a deliberate generation policy.
- Deliver session-affecting workspace changes to every relevant live engine,
  including permission rules, approval/workflow settings, providers and skills.
  Define acknowledgements and partial-failure handling; a newly applied deny
  rule must not silently leave existing Managed sessions on old permissions.

These are acceptance gates for #12380 host integration, not capabilities supplied
by the current Legacy-only workspace-control implementation. The B2b follow-up,
[Paired engine workspace runtime identity](./2026-09-26-paired-engine-workspace-runtime-identity.md),
specifies the first two gates, and
[Paired engine workspace change propagation](./2026-09-27-paired-engine-workspace-change-propagation.md)
specifies the third.

This slice's workspace-stop receipt addresses one physical channel, so stopping
multiple live channels is blocked; a single live channel remains stoppable. The
B2b follow-up extends the receipt to every live channel. Managed
branch/side-task requests reject before mutating history.

## Files and consumers

| Area                | Files / consumers                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Public construction | `bridgeOptions.ts`, package `index.ts`; daemon, Channels, SDK/embedded Bridge constructors |
| Channel ownership   | `channel-lifecycle.ts`, `channel-startup.ts`, `channel-harness.ts`                         |
| Session routing     | `session-control-plane.ts`, `BridgeClient` callbacks                                       |
| Verification        | Collocated Bridge/lifecycle tests and isolated process test script                         |

Every constructor stays on the single-factory path unless paired engines are
enabled: `qwen serve --experimental-paired-engines` pairs the daemon's ordinary
workspace runtimes, and an embedder that sets the same serve option pairs the
serve app's default Bridge
([paired engine host wiring](./2026-09-26-paired-engine-host-wiring.md)). There
are no new daemon routes. Workspace control is workspace scoped;
all session operations belong to the live session owner. A missing or failed
Managed owner must never resolve through a Legacy or primary-runtime fallback.

## Validation and acceptance criteria

1. Both engines coexist, with startup coalescing and shared session/ID limits.
2. Changing the selector default cannot change an attached or durably owned
   session. Selection and Managed failures cause zero other-engine dispatches.
3. Matching receipts permit registration; missing/conflicting receipts and
   malformed/colliding IDs reject without losing physical resource accounting.
4. Prompts, cancellation, permissions, replay and close stay on their owner;
   another channel cannot inject events or answer for that session.
5. Idle cleanup, quarantine, delayed startup, late responses and shutdown cover
   both engines and preserve replacement generations.
6. Existing single-factory tests remain green. Run build, typecheck, bundle,
   focused unit tests and isolated process verification. Test doubles prove the
   Bridge contract, not durable host persistence or Hosted inference.

## Risks and open questions

The highest risks are releasing admission before cleanup and treating one
engine's current channel as the entire workspace. Tests must observe actual
factory/connection calls and pending teardown, not only final session counts.
The owner persistence dependency and production host receipt implementation
remain the integration questions posted in #12380; the Bridge seam is usable
for contract tests while those are resolved. The B2a follow-up implements the
Legacy receipt and the restore selector; B2d wires paired engines into ordinary
hosts behind an experimental opt-in, with no Managed engine registered yet.
