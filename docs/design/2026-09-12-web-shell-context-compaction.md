# Web Shell context overview and manual compression

## Problem and current behavior

The composer tooltip, transcript context cards, and right-side context panel
already expose token usage. Category totals and detailed lists are separated,
making readers find the same category twice. Remaining capacity is not prominent,
and the panel has no direct way to run the existing `/compress` command.

## Goals and scope

Deliver clearer context accounting and manual compression in one change. Reuse
existing usage data and compression behavior. Do not add new daemon routes,
change compression algorithms, invent a system-prompt sub-breakdown, or change
the composer's click-to-transcript behavior.

## Presentation

The tooltip shows exact used, total, and remaining counts from existing local
counters; hovering does not request data. Remaining capacity is the nonnegative
difference between the context window and used tokens, and includes the
compression buffer. It must not be labeled as free space.

Both full context surfaces share an overview followed by the used/free/buffer
legend and an advanced category disclosure. Put per-item details immediately
under their category total, preserving separate built-in and MCP tools, full
names, loaded skill bodies, and token ordering. Keep the continuous proportional
meter and existing warning/error thresholds. Numeric values use readable theme
tokens and tabular figures. Sidebar categories start collapsed; transcript
details start expanded. Disclosure state lasts for the current mount.

Transcript readings are explicitly labeled as snapshots. Detailed snapshots
offer the existing current-context read action when available. Refreshes and
compression never rewrite previous snapshots. When no usage count is available
and no local history estimate exists, label the total as unavailable and the
breakdown as estimated base overhead, excluding conversation messages. When no
usage count is available but a local history estimate is non-zero, label the
breakdown as estimated usage that includes the conversation and show a Messages
row for it. Do not infer an empty conversation or absent API responses. Cold
load and resume authenticate the restored model before
initializing chat, so saved token counts bind to the authenticated route and
remain readable without sending a new message. A restored conversation without
saved usage retains an unknown count; it must never borrow another session's
process-wide telemetry count.

## Manual compression and ownership

The current context panel offers manual compression beside Refresh. Execute the
canonical `/compress` command through the owning live session's existing prompt
lifecycle. Await completion, show pending and failure feedback, prevent duplicate
submissions, and refresh current context after completion. Cancellation feedback
acknowledges the request; the existing backend can still
finish compression after cancellation. It must not claim that compression stopped
or succeeded. Manual Refresh after cancellation reconciles the current reading
and composer counters.

An in-flight operation stays pending when a snapshot reload replaces the client
for the same session and workspace. Once it settles, report that the connection
changed and offer Refresh; do not claim success or apply an old client's reading.
A real session/workspace switch discards the operation, even if the user returns.

Controls are supplied by the owning main view or split pane, including its live
busy, connection, and write-block state. Recheck ownership and availability at
invocation and after asynchronous work. In split view, sessions in the pane set
require their pane's controls, including during registration and cleanup. The
primary session retains its own controls when it is outside that set.
Restored foreign-session tabs are
read-only until their live owner supplies controls. A restored tab's read adapter
may inherit unrelated actions, so it is never a source of mutation authority.
Switching sessions, closing a pane, or unmounting a panel must not apply an old
result to a new session. Before submission, the host disarms the previous prompt's
retry state and clears stale follow-up suggestions. The ordinary composer draft and attachments are
retained.

Settled results follow the session across main-view and split-pane transitions.
The app retains the last outcome without granting operation authority to an
unmounted pane. Counter reads are deduplicated while their captured connection
owner remains current. A session switch or replay recovery can restore old
counters even on the same reader, so the next eligible owner reconciles again.
Failed reconciliation remains recoverable with Refresh. Automatic reconciliation
skips failed command outcomes; opening or explicitly refreshing a panel after any
settled outcome still synchronizes the newly read snapshot. A new live outcome takes precedence over the
retained result, so a failed second compression cannot restore an older reading.
Changing readers for the same session preserves the panel's current reading.
Reopening the panel can seed a completed reading; if the new read fails
transiently, the panel labels it as a previous reading instead of claiming it
was refreshed. Successful Refresh clears that label. A pane compressing the
primary session also disarms the main view's ordinary-prompt retry before
submitting, without clearing another session's retry.

Only the advertised built-in `compress` command enables the action; an identically
named custom command is not compression authority. Reuse the existing Goal gate
and source view's busy/write guards, including a pane's pending mode change when
preparing a `/plan` prompt. Compression output does not carry ordinary
usage metadata, so the completion read explicitly reconciles composer counters
through `getContextUsage({ syncCounters: true })`. This opt-in updates neither
billing usage, model-configured context window, nor history, and only applies to the same session/model if no newer
usage arrived while reading. Unknown zero counts preserve the last known
counters; positive estimates remain valid, including after compression. A refresh
failure after successful compression has separate feedback and must not automatically repeat compression.
Refreshing the usage ratio alone does not restart or withdraw a composer
suggestion. The next input or other suggestion trigger uses the latest ratio.

## Implementation areas

- `ChatEditor` and its tests: remaining capacity in the lightweight tooltip.
- `ContextUsageMessage`, styles, and tests: shared overview and nested categories.
- `ContextUsagePanel`, styles, and tests: compression controls and feedback.
- `App`, `ChatPane`, and `ArtifactPanel`: live owner controls and their lifecycle.
- Session actions: opt-in reconciliation of owner-scoped composer counters.
- English/Chinese strings and browser context scenarios.

## Risks and validation

The principal risk is a stale or cross-session mutation. Verify active and idle
sessions, rapid clicks, busy tasks, connection loss, cancellation, session changes,
and restored foreign tabs. Verify post-compression counters and preserve previous
snapshots. Check zero/estimated/over-limit readings, long names, keyboard
disclosures, light/dark themes, and narrow composer/panel widths.

Run a baseline with the global CLI, then validate the built local application,
root build/typecheck/bundle, and affected package tests. Read the full proposed
diff in open-ended and reverse-audit passes until two consecutive passes are
clean. Publish actual before/after UI captures in the PR using the fork's assets
branch.

## Acceptance criteria and open questions

All three context surfaces agree on used and remaining capacity. Category details
appear once under their totals. Compression is available only for its idle,
writable live owner; pending, failure, and completion are visible. Current usage
refreshes while historical readings remain unchanged. A failed subsequent
compression cannot replace a newer panel reading with an older result. A fallback
reading after a transient refresh failure is explicitly marked as previous and
can recover through Refresh. No open product questions.
