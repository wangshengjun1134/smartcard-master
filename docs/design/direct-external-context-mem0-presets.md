## Decision

The private Direct External Context integration uses one `mem0` provider type
with an administrator-selected, versioned built-in preset for Mem0-compatible
REST services. A preset owns the upstream wire contract; instance
configuration owns only the deployment endpoint, credential reference, fixed
scope, and timeout inherited from the direct profile.

This replaces provider types that combine a product name with one hard-coded
protocol, such as `polardb-mem0`. It does not expose a free-form API version,
request template, custom header map, JSONPath expression, or dynamic provider
module. The model-facing MCP contract remains `context_search({ query })` and,
only for an explicitly enabled version 1 configuration whose preset defines a
verified direct-import operation, `context_remember({ content })`.

The existing `mem0-platform-v3` configuration remains accepted for backward
compatibility. New deployments use `type: "mem0"`.

## Why a preset instead of `apiVersion`

One upstream product can mix operation versions. PolarDB Mem0 search and
direct import, for example, use different versioned paths. Authentication,
scope placement, result fields, write response semantics, and trailing-slash
requirements also vary independently of a numeric API version.

A preset therefore identifies one complete, verified contract. Published
preset identifiers are immutable. An incompatible upstream change receives a
new identifier rather than silently changing an existing mapping.

The built-in presets are:

- `mem0-platform-v3`
- `mem0-oss-rest-2026-08`
- `aliyun-polardb-mysql-2026-08`
- `mem0-v2`
- `mem0-v3`
- `mem0-oss-2026-08`

## Configuration

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "timeoutMs": 5000,
  "provider": {
    "type": "mem0",
    "preset": "aliyun-polardb-mysql-2026-08",
    "endpoint": {
      "origin": "https://memory.example.com",
      "basePath": ""
    },
    "credentialEnv": "MEM0_API_KEY",
    "scope": {
      "userId": "repository-memory",
      "agentId": "qwen-code"
    }
  }
}
```

`origin` contains only scheme and authority. `basePath` is a static optional
reverse-proxy prefix. They are validated separately so joining a preset path
cannot discard a configured prefix or reinterpret endpoint authority.
Embedded URL credentials, query strings, fragments, dot segments, encoded path
material, whitespace, and control characters are rejected from endpoint
configuration.

HTTPS is required by default. Loopback HTTP is accepted for local relays.
Non-loopback HTTP requires the explicit `allowInsecureHttp` flag and sends the
credential and memory content in cleartext; it is intended only for deployments
whose trusted private network is deliberately part of the boundary.

The preset declares which scope values it consumes and whether each value is
required or optional. Startup fails closed when a required value is missing or
when configuration supplies a value the selected preset does not use. Scope is
administrator input and never appears in tool arguments.

One absolute `QWEN_EXTERNAL_CONTEXT_CONFIG` path is loaded once per MCP child.
The path, file contents, endpoint, preset, scope, and credential-to-corpus
binding must remain immutable for the whole Qwen session, including MCP child
restarts. Switching any of them requires a new Qwen session and a new config
path.

## Bounded preset contract

Built-in presets select only reviewed constants:

- `Authorization: Token`, `Authorization: Bearer`, or `X-API-Key`
- one static POST search path
- `top_k` or `limit` as the result-limit field
- `user_id`, `agent_id`, and `app_id` placed at the JSON root, under
  `filters`, or omitted
- a closed set of fixed search options such as `threshold` and `rerank`
- a `results` response collection with reviewed identifier and content fields
- optional single-user direct-import message decoding, only for `mem0-v2` results marked `infer: false`
- an optional static direct-import path and one reviewed response mapping

The engine always sends at most five as the provider limit and retains at most
five valid results. It does not retry, redirect, probe alternate paths, or
fallback between presets. A malformed item is dropped independently; a
malformed response envelope fails the request.

Adding a preset requires authoritative protocol evidence plus request and
response contract tests. A service that cannot fit this grammar uses its own
local or remote MCP Extension under the External Context Provider Extensions
design instead of expanding this configuration into a programming language.

## Initial mappings

### Mem0 Platform V3

- Search: `POST /v3/memories/search/`
- Authentication: `Authorization: Token`
- Scope: required `appId` under `filters.app_id`
- Limit: `top_k`
- Direct import: `POST /v3/memories/add/`, `infer: false`
- Write response: `PENDING` plus a UUID `event_id` is `accepted`; only
  `SUCCEEDED` is `stored`

The legacy `mem0-platform-v3` configuration remains a fixed-endpoint shorthand
for this mapping.

### Mem0 OSS REST 2026-08

- Search: `POST /search`
- Authentication: `X-API-Key`
- Scope: required `userId` and optional `agentId` under `filters`
- Limit: `top_k`
- Direct import: `POST /memories`, `infer: false`
- Write response: a valid `results[].id` is `stored`; otherwise `unknown`

This mapping follows the stock `mem0ai/mem0` REST server. Bearer-authenticated
deployments need a separately verified preset rather than a per-instance
authentication override.

### Aliyun PolarDB MySQL 2026-08

- Search: `POST /v2/memories/search`
- Authentication: `Authorization: Token`
- Scope: required `userId` under `filters`, optional top-level `agentId`
- Limit: `top_k`
- Direct import: `POST /v1/memories`, `infer: false`
- Write response: a valid `results[].id` is `stored`; otherwise `unknown`

The historical `aliyun-polardb-mysql-2026-08` identifier keeps `top_k` and raw search content. The newer `mem0-v2` mapping uses `limit` and unwraps one nonempty user message from an `infer: false` direct-import result. It leaves ordinary text, other message arrays, and results without that marker unchanged. `mem0-v3` and `mem0-oss-2026-08` alias the corresponding legacy V3 and OSS contracts without changing them.

An `event_id` alone is never treated as proof of storage. If a later PolarDB
contract documents asynchronous event polling, that behavior requires a new
preset and write design rather than changing this preset in place.

## Protocol evidence

- Mem0 Platform V3 follows the official
  [search API](https://docs.mem0.ai/api-reference/memory/search-memories) and
  [V2-to-V3 migration contract](https://docs.mem0.ai/migration/platform-v2-to-v3).
- Mem0 OSS REST is pinned to upstream commit
  [`39bc023`](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0/tree/39bc02330563764e7d4465f1ecff5f002d94da1a),
  specifically [`server/main.py`](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0/blob/39bc02330563764e7d4465f1ecff5f002d94da1a/server/main.py)
  and [`server/auth.py`](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0/blob/39bc02330563764e7d4465f1ecff5f002d94da1a/server/auth.py).
- The PolarDB preset follows the official
  [PolarDB for MySQL Mem0 contract](https://help.aliyun.com/en/polardb/polardb-for-mysql/use-polardb-mem0)
  and the [live end-to-end evidence](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/pull/9952#issuecomment-5407141853)
  recorded for this PR. The public documentation covers the endpoint,
  authentication, and scope placement; the live instance additionally proves
  that `infer: false` is honored for direct import.

Tests must continue to pin these exact request and response shapes. If an
upstream contract changes incompatibly, add a new preset identifier instead of
updating an existing mapping in place.

## Relationship to provider Extensions

This provider is a bounded compatibility feature inside the already private
`integrations/external-context` process. It is not a public provider registry.
Third-party teams still own independently distributed integrations through
MCP Extensions. The direct preset path is appropriate only for Mem0-family
contracts that Qwen maintainers explicitly verify and agree to maintain.

Operators must enable either this direct server or another Mem0 Extension for
one corpus, not both. Exposing two `context_search` tools for the same corpus
would make provider selection model-controlled and could duplicate queries.

## Verification

The implementation must prove:

- strict configuration parsing and fail-closed preset/scope validation
- safe `origin` plus `basePath` joining
- exact authentication, path, scope, and limit mapping for every preset
- per-item response normalization and the five-result cap
- preservation of historical preset responses alongside the bounded `mem0-v2` direct-import decoding
- conservative synchronous versus asynchronous write outcomes
- no retry on search or write failures
- loadability of the shipped PolarDB and OSS examples
- compatibility of the existing `mem0-platform-v3` configuration
