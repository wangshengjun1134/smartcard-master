# Android microphone permission

[English](mobile-microphone-permission.md) | [简体中文](mobile-microphone-permission.zh-CN.md)

## Problem and current state

The Web Shell already captures microphone audio with `getUserMedia`, converts it to PCM and sends it through its authenticated voice WebSocket. The native shell currently denies WebView permission requests and declares no recording permission. Qwen Live also uses browser `getUserMedia` in `live/useLiveBrowserHost.ts` for its `/live/web` audio path. This slice enables both existing capture paths; it does not implement another recorder or transcription service. It builds on the isolated connection-profile development shell.

## Design

Only a request for exactly `RESOURCE_AUDIO_CAPTURE` from the current attached WebView and configured daemon origin is eligible. The requesting origin and current top-level origin must both match. HTTPS and explicitly allowed loopback HTTP origins are supported; no TLS exceptions are added. Camera, mixed audio/video and unknown resources are denied without an Android permission prompt.

The permission controller parses the configured origin with the same strict `java.net.URI` parser used by `OriginPolicy`. Android 8's `android.net.Uri` host parsing splits bracketed IPv6 at a colon; using it for the loopback allow-list incorrectly rejects `[::1]`. Malformed origins are denied before requesting consent.

A native dialog names the connection origin and asks the user to enable its microphone. This explicit action is required for each new WebView recording request, even if the application already has Android recording permission. After confirmation, the shell requests `RECORD_AUDIO` through the Activity Result API when needed. It checks the current view, origin, visible lifecycle and OS permission again before granting only audio capture. Android denial leaves text usage available. No permission request is launched at app startup.

One pending request owns the consent dialog and any outstanding system result. Navigation, connection failure, backgrounding, switching profiles and destruction cancel the pending request. A cancelled system request retains its result slot until the OS responds; a new document cannot adopt the old result. Recreation persists only that in-flight flag, not the WebView request. WebView cancellation hides the dialog without responding again to its cancelled request.

WebView's permission grant can last for the lifetime of the view, and its native API does not report reliably when individual audio tracks stop. Therefore a connection which has been granted microphone access is closed whenever the Activity stops. This includes fully hiding the app and Activity recreation after changes such as dark mode, language, font scale or display density, even while the app remains visible. Losing focus while still visible in split-screen or behind a translucent Activity does not trigger teardown. The native UI explains this before consent. An ordinary stop offers manual reconnection afterward; Activity recreation returns to Connections without retaining that notice. This applies to dictation and Qwen Live browser audio, including an active Live call, even if dictation already ended or another fullscreen Activity is opened. Returning does not automatically resume a Live call. Unsent in-page state may be lost. Text-only connections survive an ordinary stop, but their existing recreation behavior is unchanged. This deliberate development-client tradeoff destroys an authorized WebView on stop; it does not stop visible split-screen capture merely because another app has focus. No background recorder or foreground service is introduced. A future coordinated H5/native capture lifecycle may improve this behavior.

System document Open/Save needs a preflight because launching a picker would stop the Activity and destroy the page before it receives the result. For a microphone-authorized connection, the Activity intercepts `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT` and `ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT` before launch and asynchronously returns the normal cancelled result to its launcher. It then offers **Keep editing** (retain the current page) or **Reconnect** (explicitly discard transient page state and stop microphone access). The user retries the file operation after reconnecting. No document destination is created by a blocked request. The guard lives in the microphone slice's Activity so the independent picker and download slices use it without acquiring each other's implementations. It does not resume a cancelled file operation or claim seamless microphone/file interoperability.

Native AppOps diagnostics observed an active-to-inactive recording transition and renewed consent on repeated `getUserMedia` on API36/WebView134, including a cloned audio track. An inactive app-op alone is not a documented lifetime revocation of WebView's capture permission, so this patch does not use that observation to relax background teardown.

## Components and scope

The manifest declares recording permission, the normal MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS permission needed by Chromium audio input, and marks microphone hardware optional. `NativeMicrophonePermission.kt` owns request/result state; `MainActivity.kt` owns origin-labelled consent UI, the runtime launcher and view lifetime. Strings, the mobile README and instrumentation tests describe and verify the behavior. Existing H5 voice authentication, capability checks, secure-context rules, audio processing and owner-change cleanup remain authoritative. No daemon route, JavaScript bridge, audio storage or new dependency is added.

This is permission integration for a development client, not production mobile release approval. Physical microphone quality, transcription accuracy, background voice and per-device daemon revocation are outside this change.

## Verification and acceptance

- Establish on the parent APK that the actual WebChromeClient denies audio requests.
- Build debug/release, run existing JVM/storage/profile tests, lint and focused permission-state instrumentation.
- Check explicit native denial, OS denial and grant, already-granted OS permission, wrong origin, unknown/mixed resources and concurrent requests.
- Verify cancelled or restored OS results cannot authorize a replacement request; navigation and destruction invalidate pending consent.
- On a supported emulator, activate actual `getUserMedia` from a synthetic local page, accept/deny the native and OS prompts and check a live audio track only after consent. No host microphone input or actual speech is required.
- Exercise dictation and Qwen Live browser audio separately against a configured daemon; grant/deny consent, background an active capture and verify returning requires explicit reconnect without automatically resuming a Live call. These are daemon/device acceptance checks, not established by permission-controller tests.
- Background a microphone-enabled connection and verify its WebView is destroyed and manual reconnect UI appears. Verify a text-only connection survives the same transition. Record device/provider versions and actual gaps rather than claiming physical-device or daemon verification.
- In split-screen or behind a translucent Activity, move focus away without recreating the Activity and verify the connection remains open. Fully hide it and verify microphone teardown and the reconnect notice. Separately force Activity recreation while visible: the connection closes and Connections reappears without a retained notice; capture must not resume automatically.
- In a combined picker/download build, try Open and Save after native microphone consent. Verify the system chooser never opens, the request is cancelled exactly once, Keep editing retains the same page/draft, and a second request is not stuck busy. Reconnect explicitly, retry Open/Save and verify actual bytes. No empty destination should be created by the blocked Save. Background an actively recording page and confirm the existing teardown remains effective.

## Open follow-ups

Maintainer review should confirm the explicit close-on-background tradeoff before merging. Improve voice/page-state preservation in a separately designed follow-up, and test real HTTPS daemons and physical devices before an official mobile release. Per-device revocable daemon credentials remain a maintainer-owned prerequisite.
