# Assembling the System Prompt from the Resident Tool Set

[English](2026-09-18-resident-tool-prompt-assembly.md) | [简体中文](2026-09-18-resident-tool-prompt-assembly.zh-CN.md)

**Status:** proposal for [#12032](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/12032), part of [#12028](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/12028). Step 1 only (session-start assembly); step 2 is named as follow-up work and is not proposed here.

Every code reference below was read on `main` at `8bd2feabba`. Nothing was built, run, or measured for this document; the token figures attributed to #12032 are that issue's own measurements and were not re-measured.

## 1. Problem

The system prompt describes the tool surface from static `ToolNames` constants and boolean config flags, independent of which tools the request actually declares. `getToolGuidanceSection` (`packages/core/src/core/prompts.ts:299`) interpolates tool names into policy bullets, and the four `# Examples` blocks are `[tool_call: …]` transcripts (21 occurrences of `tool_call:` in that file). Meanwhile the declared set is decided elsewhere, at `ToolRegistry.getFunctionDeclarations` (`packages/core/src/tools/tool-registry.ts:850`), and shrinks whenever a deployment sets `tools.eager`, adds a whole-tool `permissions.deny` rule, or leaves a tool deferred behind ToolSearch.

Two consequences, in order of importance:

1. **Correctness.** The prompt instructs the model to prefer tools it was not given. A session with `glob` demoted still reads "For file search: Use glob (NOT find or ls)", and the model's only way to discover the mismatch is a failed call or a ToolSearch round-trip.
2. **Tokens.** Per #12032, roughly 7.3 KB of the base prompt is structurally tool-bound (`## Using Your Tools` ~4,031 chars, of which ~66% of lines name a specific tool; `# Examples` 3,283 chars, entirely tool-call transcripts). That text stays resident even when the tools it describes are not.

For a **default** session every tool is resident, so the token saving is exactly zero. The payoff exists only for deployments that already trim their tool set — which is why the correctness half is the part worth paying for, and why the issue is `priority/P3` despite a P0 downstream dependency.

## 2. Current state

Three references in the prompt are **not** interpolated from `ToolNames` and therefore cannot be gated without touching their text first:

- `subagent_type=Explore` (`prompts.ts:328`, `:348`) — subagent availability is data-driven from the subagent manager, not from the tool registry.
- Bare `read_file` in prose: the four examples (`:901`, `:1152`, `:1270`, `:1355`), the persisted-output mandate (`:420`), and the plan-mode reminder (`:1480`, a per-turn reminder rather than part of the base prompt).
- The `GlobTool` display name inside the examples (`:913`, `:1185`, `:1288`, `:1367`).

Test surface that moves with any change here: 17 full-prompt snapshots (`core/__snapshots__/prompts.test.ts.snap`), and `prompt-tool-examples.test.ts:99`, which asserts that the set of tool names appearing in the examples equals its validator keys exactly — that assertion breaks the moment any example becomes conditional. The precedent for conditional-section assertions is `prompts.test.ts:1248`.

## 3. Goals and non-goals

**Goals.** The base prompt describes only tools the session actually declares. `/context` and the real request agree on that set. The prompt-cache prefix is rewritten no more often than it is today. Safety, permission, and dangerous-action text stays unconditional.

**Non-goals.** Regenerating the prompt on every mid-session reveal (step 2, and it overlaps [#11321](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/11321)). Subagent prompts. A new user-facing setting. Editing safety text. Shortening individual tool descriptions ([#12054](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/12054)). Gating the skill listing or memory files ([#12030](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/12030)).

## 4. Proposed design

### 4.1 Resolve the declared set once per session

In `startChat`, after `warmAll()` and the budget preload and before the instruction is built (between `client.ts:2326` and `:2348`), collect the declared tool names from `getFunctionDeclarations()` into a `ReadonlySet<string>` and record it on `Config` as the snapshot the prompt was built from. The prompt builder receives that set; it never sees the registry.

Recording the snapshot — rather than recomputing from the registry at every read — is what keeps `/context` honest: after a mid-session ToolSearch reveal the live registry and the prompt genuinely disagree, and `/context` must report what the prompt contains, not what the registry now holds. When no snapshot exists yet (a caller that builds a prompt before any `startChat`, including `ArenaManager`), the builder falls back to today's behaviour and emits every section.

### 4.2 API shape

`getCoreSystemPrompt` is re-exported from the package root and called positionally at two non-test sites, and its arity is asserted in `client.test.ts` and `contextCommand.test.ts`. Adding an eighth positional parameter would break those assertions and every external caller's expectations, so the new input arrives as a trailing options object:

```ts
getCoreSystemPrompt(
  userMemory?: string,
  model?: string,
  appendInstruction?: string,
  interactionMode?: SystemPromptInteractionMode,
  outputStyle?: OutputStyleDefinition | null,
  todoWriteEnabled?: boolean,
  codeModeOnly?: boolean,
  options?: { declaredTools?: ReadonlySet<string> },
): string;
```

`declaredTools === undefined` means "assume everything is declared", which is exactly today's output. `MainSessionPromptConfig` (`client.ts:380`) does not gain `getToolRegistry`: passing a resolved set keeps `prompts.ts` decoupled from tool internals, and a `Pick<Config, …>` that reaches the registry would also drag the warm-up contract into every caller that builds a prompt.

### 4.3 What each section gates on

Subagent availability is not registry state; gating it needs the subagent manager and is an open question (§9).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

### 4.4 Prompt cache

The prompt depends only on the session-start snapshot, so `setStaticSystemPrefix` (`client.ts:1672`) is rewritten exactly as often as today — once per instruction build — and a mid-session reveal keeps changing only the tools block. This is a stated design constraint, not a caveat: wiring `refreshSystemInstruction` into the reveal sites would rewrite the globally cached block on every ToolSearch load, and it pulls against [#12029](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/12029), whose whole purpose is to make deferral (and therefore reveals) actually happen on large windows. #12029 should reference this constraint so the net cache behaviour is chosen rather than inherited.

### 4.5 `/context`

`collectContextData` builds the prompt through `getMainSessionBaseSystemPrompt` and reads declarations separately, and it does not warm the registry. It therefore reads the same snapshot, which keeps its system-prompt row consistent with the request. This lands on top of the breakdown rework in [#12119](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/pull/12119) (#12033), whose numbers are the measurement instrument for §7.

## 5. Design decisions

| Decision                                    | Rationale                                                                                                             | Alternative rejected                                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Session-start only                          | No cache regression, no wiring into ~15 mutation sites, and the ordering in `startChat` already makes it well defined | Per-reveal regeneration — step 2, and it needs measurement first |
| Pass a resolved `ReadonlySet<string>`       | Keeps `prompts.ts` free of registry coupling and of the warm-up contract                                              | Widen `MainSessionPromptConfig` with `getToolRegistry`           |
| Trailing options object                     | Preserves the 7-parameter public signature and the arity assertions                                                   | An eighth positional parameter                                   |
| Record the snapshot on `Config`             | `/context` must report what the prompt says, not what the registry now holds                                          | Recompute from the registry at each read                         |
| Absent snapshot means "everything declared" | Keeps `ArenaManager` and any external caller byte-identical                                                           | Require every caller to pass a set                               |
| Safety sections stay unconditional          | A denied-call or dangerous-action clause is not about tool availability                                               | Gate them for consistency                                        |

## 6. Constraints and risks

- **Snapshot churn in tests.** All 17 full-prompt snapshots regenerate unless the fixtures pin a declared set. Fixtures must pin one, or the snapshots stop testing the gating.
- **`prompt-tool-examples.test.ts:99` still passes.** It renders the ungated prompt, so its exact-equality assertion between example tool names and validator keys is untouched. It would only need reworking if gating ever became the default rather than opt-in.
- **`ask_user_question` stays ungated inside the gated section.** The interaction-mode bullet that names it also carries the policy for _not_ asking questions in a headless run, so gating the bullet would drop real guidance with it. The tool is exempt from `tools.eager` and therefore declared in practice; only a `permissions.deny` rule can remove it, and that configuration still reads the bullet. The exhaustive test in §7 excludes exactly this name and nothing else.
- **Two prose mentions stay ungated.** The persisted-output mandate (`prompts.ts:420`) and the plan-mode reminder (`:1480`) name `read_file` outside `## Using Your Tools`, so a session that does not declare it still reads them. That is pre-existing behaviour rather than a regression introduced here, and it is why §7's invariant test is scoped to the gated sections.
- **Dropping guidance for a tool that _is_ declared would be a regression**, and no CI test would catch it today. §7 adds the invariant test that closes this.
- **Core gate.** The change lands in `packages/core/src/core/**`, which is reviewed at the core gate's 100%-confidence bar; a `feat` reaching 500+ production lines escalates to a maintainer for awareness.
- **No recall harness exists.** There is no `evals/` directory, and the only agentic harness (`integration-tests/terminal-bench`) is manual-only, so "the model still picks the right tool" cannot be asserted in CI. The mitigation is that step 1 only removes text about tools the model does not have.

## 7. Validation plan

Items 1-4 are automated in this PR's `prompts.test.ts`, so every push re-checks them; item 5 needs a real session and is handed off in [`docs/verification/resident-tool-prompt-assembly/README.md`](../verification/resident-tool-prompt-assembly/README.md).

1. **Default-session regression (in CI).** The 17 existing full-prompt snapshots cover the no-snapshot path, and `renders identically when every tool is declared` covers the all-declared path. Together they are the guard that makes the change safe for the common case.
2. **Effect, and no drift outside it (in CI).** Two tests bracket the saving: a file-work allowlist must drop 900-1,400 characters (measured 1,104, ~276 tokens — policy bullets only, since that allowlist keeps every example), and a narrower allowlist must drop 3,800-5,000 (measured 4,327, ~1,082 tokens, three example blocks included). A third asserts all four model-specific example notations are gated, not just the bracket form. Together they fail on a lost saving and on newly added ungated tool text. `changes nothing outside the two gated sections` strips `## Using Your Tools` and `# Examples` from both renders and asserts the remainder is identical.
3. **Invariant, both directions (in CI).** `never names an undeclared tool inside the gated sections` sweeps every `ToolNames` value against the gated text with a word-boundary match, and `gates every tool name the gated sections can mention, on every example set` makes that config-independent by withholding each of the 66 names in turn against all four example sets — the check that would have caught the model-specific notations going ungated. `keeps the policy text of every tool that is declared` pins the opposite direction so gating cannot over-reach. Scoped to those sections because of the residues in §6.
4. **Reverse checks and plumbing (in CI).** `leaves CodeModeOnly guidance untouched by the declared set` asserts code mode renders identically with and without a snapshot, and `takes the declared set from the Config snapshot` asserts `getMainSessionBaseSystemPrompt` reads `Config.getPromptToolSnapshot()` — the property that keeps `/context` and the request on one source.
5. **Token measurement (handed off).** On a session with a trimmed `tools.eager` allowlist, compare the system-prompt row before and after, anchored on the provider's `input_token_count` (the category ruler itself is being fixed in #12119). The brief also carries the three-way run that separates this change's saving from `tools.eager`'s own, and the weakened recall check that is all the repo's missing eval harness allows.

## 8. Acceptance criteria

- A default session's base prompt is unchanged, byte for byte.
- In a trimmed session, no bullet or example names a tool that is not declared, and every declared tool's policy text is still present.
- Safety, permission, and dangerous-action text is present in every configuration.
- `setStaticSystemPrefix` is written no more often than before this change.
- `/context`'s system-prompt row and the request's system instruction come from the same snapshot.
- Both language versions of this design are updated together with any later decision.

## 9. Open questions

1. **`subagent_type=Explore`:** gate it on subagent availability (which needs the subagent manager, not the registry), or leave it unconditional? Step 1 leaves it.
2. **Examples floor:** is "always keep at least one example" the right rule, or is a prompt with no `# Examples` block acceptable for a heavily trimmed deployment?
3. **Subagent prompts** remain as inconsistent as today. Should that be a follow-up issue under #12028, or explicitly accepted?
4. **`ArenaManager`** builds prompts for agents that own separate registries. Should it pass each agent's own declared set in a follow-up?
5. **Ordering with #12029:** if #12029 lands first and deferral starts engaging on large windows, does the constraint in §4.4 still hold for deployments with many MCP tools, or does step 2 become necessary sooner?
