# Web Shell composer and context readability

[English](2026-09-10-web-shell-composer-context.md) | [简体中文](2026-09-10-web-shell-composer-context.zh-CN.md)

## Problem and scope

The composer reserves 140px even for an empty prompt. Its context ring requires
hovering to read the occupancy. The context sidebar places every name and token
value on separate lines and expands every tool, memory, and skill detail, making
the overview difficult to scan.

This change improves the existing Web Shell presentation. It does not change
prompt submission, context accounting, API routes, session ownership, polling,
or public customization options.

## Design

The hover interaction is extended by [Composer context shortcuts](2026-09-13-web-shell-hover-compression.md). Its interactive card preserves the local counter, accessible used/window description, and secondary-text requirements below.

- Reduce the default composer minimum height to 116px and show a subtle focus
  border while the editor, toolbar popup, or reference picker is active. Escape restores the
  popup trigger focus; choosing an insertion keeps its existing focus action.
  Preserve automatic growth, existing maximum heights, attachment
  scrolling, and host CSS variables.
- Show the context percentage beside the existing ring when the composer is
  wider than 520px. Narrow composers keep the ring and its accessible label and
  tooltip. Both parts invoke the existing context action (`/context`). Warning
  and error percentages use the same severity as the ring. Unavailable primary
  and split-pane composers suppress stale counts and their unavailable context
  action using the same connection-state predicate.
- Replace the one-line hover text with a structured tooltip showing occupancy,
  a proportional meter, used tokens, the context-window size, and a localized
  hint that clicking displays usage in the conversation. Hover uses existing
  local counters without fetching context or creating a transcript message.
  Assistive technology receives a concise localized used/window description.
  Normal percentages, tooltip labels and hints, and detail-group counts use the
  existing secondary text token for legibility in both themes.
- Keep the sidebar overview visible. Align category and detail values to the
  right, allow long names to wrap, and keep token numbers readable.
- Make tool, memory, and skill detail groups native disclosures in compact mode,
  initially collapsed, with item counts. Keyboard activation reveals the same
  complete, sorted details. Transcript detail groups start expanded and can
  also be collapsed. Activating a native summary pauses transcript bottom
  following during that interaction. Disclosure choices last only for the
  current mount: after a virtualized transcript row is removed and remounted,
  its groups start expanded again; a remounted sidebar starts collapsed.
  Persisting these choices across unmounts is outside this layout change.
- Render transcript cards with the same proportional meter, responsive columns,
  and complete wrapping names in the interface sans-serif font. Show occupancy
  beside the title; transcript cards are named groups rather than individual
  region landmarks, so repeated readings do not crowd landmark navigation.
  Compact cards remain unnamed inside the artifact panel. A localized
  "View details" button invokes the existing `/context detail` action; read-only
  renderers without a callback retain the command hint. Detail names are shown
  in full, without the unused internal length override.

Reuse existing CSS Modules and theme variables. Native details/summary provide
keyboard interaction without adding a dependency or custom disclosure state.
Keep estimated, unavailable, loading, retry, and over-limit states intact.

## Affected files

`ChatEditor.tsx`, `ChatEditor.module.css`, `ContextUsageMessage.tsx`, and
`ContextUsageMessage.module.css`, the primary and split-pane availability guards, transcript follow
guard, add menu focus handling, localization, plus focused tests and browser
tests under `packages/web-shell/client/`.

## Validation and acceptance

Dry-run with the globally installed `qwen` before editing, then verify the local
build. Check empty and multiline prompts, capped scrolling, attachment layout,
desktop and touch submission, wide/narrow toolbars, and light/dark presentation.
Check disclosure activation, counts, complete long names, sorted token values,
estimated and over-limit readings, hover/focus without requests, and clicking
the ring followed by "View details". Read-only rendering retains the command
hint; explicit detail requests start expanded. Test narrow transcript cards in
both themes. Pin 520/521px composer widths, actual theme colors, keyboard ring
access, resting/focused borders, reference search, and alignment on every wrapped
row. Verify left-toolbar clipping and model-button hit testing at both composer
breakpoints, readable secondary text on both surfaces, repeated named groups,
and the over-limit Used value's error colour and alignment. Tag the focused browser
coverage for the PR smoke lane.
Run build, typecheck, bundle, focused unit and browser tests, then review the
complete diff. Browser fixtures may supply deterministic context readings;
report separately from live daemon verification.

## Risks and open questions

The percentage adds toolbar width; its container breakpoint and existing
measurement logic must preserve access to send and model controls. Long context
names must wrap without forcing horizontal scrolling. No open design questions
remain for this bounded layout improvement.
