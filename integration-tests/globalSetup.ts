/**
 * Carries the host's configuration — and only that — into the hermetic global
 * qwen dir.
 *
 * The suites that talk to a real model rely on ambient auth. CI supplies it
 * through the environment, but a developer's typically lives in
 * `~/.qwen/settings.json`: as credentials under `security.auth`, as provider
 * keys in the `env` block, or as routing in `model` / `modelProviders`. There
 * is no subset of those that is safe to carry alone, so the file goes across
 * whole and a developer's setup keeps working exactly as it does today.
 *
 * What deliberately does not come across is everything the dir accumulates as
 * files: saved memories, tool-usage history, extensions, skills, commands.
 * That is the state a run has no business depending on, and the state that
 * made these suites fail. Carrying settings.json forward keeps whatever the
 * persistent pool relies on for credentials — its `~/.qwen` is populated,
 * which is how the memories got there — so this narrows the blast radius to
 * the files without gambling on where CI's auth comes from.
